.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBctest\fP executable is the CMake test driver program.
CMake\-generated build trees created for projects that use the
\fI\%enable_testing()\fP and \fI\%add_test()\fP commands have testing support.
This program will run the tests and report results.
.SH RUN TESTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-preset <preset>, \-\-preset=<preset>
Use a test preset to specify test options. The project binary directory
is inferred from the \fBconfigurePreset\fP key. The current working directory
must contain CMake preset files.
See \fI\%preset\fP for more details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-list\-presets
Lists the available test presets. The current working directory must contain
CMake preset files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C <cfg>, \-\-build\-config <cfg>
Choose configuration to test.
.sp
Some CMake\-generated build trees can have multiple build
configurations in the same tree.  This option can be used to specify
which one should be tested.  Example configurations are \fBDebug\fP and
\fBRelease\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-progress
Enable short progress output from tests.
.sp
When the output of \fBctest\fP is being sent directly to a terminal, the
progress through the set of tests is reported by updating the same line
rather than printing start and end messages for each test on new lines.
This can significantly reduce the verbosity of the test output.
Test completion messages are still output on their own line for failed
tests and the final test summary will also still be logged.
.sp
This option can also be enabled by setting the environment variable
\fI\%CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-verbose
Enable verbose output from tests.
.sp
Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
displayed.  This option will show all test output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-VV, \-\-extra\-verbose
Enable more verbose output from tests.
.sp
Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
displayed.  This option will show even more test output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-debug
Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.
.sp
This feature will result in a large number of output that is mostly
useful for debugging dashboard problems.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-output\-on\-failure
Output anything outputted by the test program if the test should fail.
This option can also be enabled by setting the
\fI\%CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE\fP environment variable
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-stop\-on\-failure
Stop running the tests when the first failure happens.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-F
Enable failover.
.sp
This option allows CTest to resume a test set execution that was
previously interrupted.  If no interruption occurred, the \fB\-F\fP option
will have no effect.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-j [<level>], \-\-parallel [<level>]
Run tests in parallel, optionally limited to a given level of parallelism.
.sp
New in version 3.29: The \fB<level>\fP may be omitted, or \fB0\fP, in which case:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Under \fI\%Job Server Integration\fP, parallelism is limited by
available job tokens.
.IP \(bu 2
Otherwise, if the value is omitted, parallelism is limited
by the number of processors, or 2, whichever is larger.
.IP \(bu 2
Otherwise, if the value is \fB0\fP, parallelism is unbounded.
.UNINDENT

.sp
This option may instead be specified by the \fI\%CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL\fP
environment variable.
.sp
This option can be used with the \fI\%PROCESSORS\fP test property.
See the \fI\%Label and Subproject Summary\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-resource\-spec\-file <file>
Run CTest with \fI\%resource allocation\fP enabled,
using the
\fI\%resource specification file\fP
specified in \fB<file>\fP\&.
.sp
When \fBctest\fP is run as a \fI\%Dashboard Client\fP this sets the
\fBResourceSpecFile\fP option of the \fI\%CTest Test Step\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-test\-load <level>
While running tests in parallel (e.g. with \fI\%\-j\fP), try
not to start tests when they may cause the CPU load to pass above a given
threshold.
.sp
When \fBctest\fP is run as a \fI\%Dashboard Client\fP this sets the
\fBTestLoad\fP option of the \fI\%CTest Test Step\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Q, \-\-quiet
Make CTest quiet.
.sp
This option will suppress all the output.  The output log file will
still be generated if the \fI\%\-\-output\-log\fP is
specified.  Options such as \fI\%\-\-verbose\fP,
\fI\%\-\-extra\-verbose\fP, and
\fI\%\-\-debug\fP are ignored
if \fB\-\-quiet\fP is specified.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-O <file>, \-\-output\-log <file>
Output to log file.
.sp
This option tells CTest to write all its output to a \fB<file>\fP log file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-output\-junit <file>
New in version 3.21.

.sp
Write test results in JUnit format.
.sp
This option tells CTest to write test results to \fB<file>\fP in JUnit XML
format. If \fB<file>\fP already exists, it will be overwritten. If using the
\fI\%\-S\fP option to run a dashboard script, use the
\fBOUTPUT_JUNIT\fP keyword with the \fI\%ctest_test()\fP command instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-show\-only[=<format>]
Disable actual execution of tests.
.sp
This option tells CTest to list the tests that would be run but not
actually run them.  Useful in conjunction with the \fI\%\-R\fP
and \fI\%\-E\fP options.
.sp
New in version 3.14: The \fB\-\-show\-only\fP option accepts a \fB<format>\fP value.

.sp
\fB<format>\fP can be one of the following values.
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBhuman\fP
Human\-friendly output.  This is not guaranteed to be stable.
This is the default.
.TP
.B \fBjson\-v1\fP

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L <regex>, \-\-label\-regex <regex>
Run tests with labels matching regular expression as described under
\fI\%string(REGEX)\fP\&.
.sp
This option tells CTest to run only the tests whose labels match the
given regular expression.  When more than one \fB\-L\fP option is given,
a test will only be run if each regular expression matches at least one
of the test\(aqs labels (i.e. the multiple \fB\-L\fP labels form an \fBAND\fP
relationship).  See \fI\%Label Matching\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-R <regex>, \-\-tests\-regex <regex>
Run tests matching regular expression.
.sp
This option tells CTest to run only the tests whose names match the
given regular expression.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-E <regex>, \-\-exclude\-regex <regex>
Exclude tests matching regular expression.
.sp
This option tells CTest to NOT run the tests whose names match the
given regular expression.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-LE <regex>, \-\-label\-exclude <regex>
Exclude tests with labels matching regular expression.
.sp
This option tells CTest to NOT run the tests whose labels match the
given regular expression.  When more than one \fB\-LE\fP option is given,
a test will only be excluded if each regular expression matches at least one
of the test\(aqs labels (i.e. the multiple \fB\-LE\fP labels form an \fBAND\fP
relationship).  See \fI\%Label Matching\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-tests\-from\-file <filename>
New in version 3.29.

.sp
Run tests listed in the given file.
.sp
This option tells CTest to run tests that are listed in the given file.
The file must contain one exact test name per line.
Lines that do not exactly match any test names are ignored.
This option can be combined with the other options like
\fB\-R\fP, \fB\-E\fP, \fB\-L\fP or \fB\-LE\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-exclude\-from\-file <filename>
New in version 3.29.

.sp
Exclude tests listed in the given file.
.sp
This option tells CTest to NOT run tests that are listed in the given file.
The file must contain one exact test name per line.
Lines that do not exactly match any test names are ignored.
This option can be combined with the other options like
\fB\-R\fP, \fB\-E\fP, \fB\-L\fP or \fB\-LE\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-FA <regex>, \-\-fixture\-exclude\-any <regex>
Exclude fixtures matching \fB<regex>\fP from automatically adding any tests to
the test set.
.sp
If a test in the set of tests to be executed requires a particular fixture,
that fixture\(aqs setup and cleanup tests would normally be added to the test set
automatically. This option prevents adding setup or cleanup tests for fixtures
matching the \fB<regex>\fP\&. Note that all other fixture behavior is retained,
including test dependencies and skipping tests that have fixture setup tests
that fail.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-FS <regex>, \-\-fixture\-exclude\-setup <regex>
Same as \fI\%\-FA\fP except only matching setup tests are
excluded.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-FC <regex>, \-\-fixture\-exclude\-cleanup <regex>
Same as \fI\%\-FA\fP except only matching cleanup tests are
excluded.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file], \-\-tests\-information
Run a specific number of tests by number.
.sp
This option causes CTest to run tests starting at number \fBStart\fP,
ending at number \fBEnd\fP, and incrementing by \fBStride\fP\&.  Any additional
numbers after \fBStride\fP are considered individual test numbers.  \fBStart\fP,
\fBEnd\fP, or \fBStride\fP can be empty.  Optionally a file can be given that
contains the same syntax as the command line.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-U, \-\-union
Take the Union of \fI\%\-I\fP and \fI\%\-R\fP\&.
.sp
When both \fI\%\-R\fP and \fI\%\-I\fP are specified
by default the intersection of tests are run.  By specifying \fB\-U\fP the union
of tests is run instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rerun\-failed
Run only the tests that failed previously.
.sp
This option tells CTest to perform only the tests that failed during
its previous run.  When this option is specified, CTest ignores all
other options intended to modify the list of tests to run (
\fI\%\-L\fP, \fI\%\-R\fP, \fI\%\-E\fP,
\fI\%\-LE\fP, \fI\%\-I\fP, etc).  In the event that
CTest runs and no tests fail, subsequent calls to CTest with the
\fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP option will run the set of tests that most recently
failed (if any).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-repeat <mode>:<n>
Run tests repeatedly based on the given \fB<mode>\fP up to \fB<n>\fP times.
The modes are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBuntil\-fail\fP
Require each test to run \fB<n>\fP times without failing in order to pass.
This is useful in finding sporadic failures in test cases.
.TP
.B \fBuntil\-pass\fP
Allow each test to run up to \fB<n>\fP times in order to pass.
Repeats tests if they fail for any reason.
This is useful in tolerating sporadic failures in test cases.
.TP
.B \fBafter\-timeout\fP
Allow each test to run up to \fB<n>\fP times in order to pass.
Repeats tests only if they timeout.
This is useful in tolerating sporadic timeouts in test cases
on busy machines.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-repeat\-until\-fail <n>
Equivalent to \fI\%\-\-repeat until\-fail:<n>\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-width <width>
Set the max width for a test name to output.
.sp
Set the maximum width for each test name to show in the output.
This allows the user to widen the output to avoid clipping the test
name which can be very annoying.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-interactive\-debug\-mode [0|1]
Set the interactive mode to \fB0\fP or \fB1\fP\&.
.sp
This option causes CTest to run tests in either an interactive mode
or a non\-interactive mode.  In dashboard mode (\fBExperimental\fP, \fBNightly\fP,
\fBContinuous\fP), the default is non\-interactive.  In non\-interactive mode,
the environment variable \fI\%DASHBOARD_TEST_FROM_CTEST\fP is set.
.sp
Prior to CMake 3.11, interactive mode on Windows allowed system debug
popup windows to appear.  Now, due to CTest\(aqs use of \fBlibuv\fP to launch
test processes, all system debug popup windows are always blocked.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-label\-summary
Disable timing summary information for labels.
.sp
This option tells CTest not to print summary information for each
label associated with the tests run.  If there are no labels on the
tests, nothing extra is printed.
.sp
See \fI\%Label and Subproject Summary\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-subproject\-summary
Disable timing summary information for subprojects.
.sp
This option tells CTest not to print summary information for each
subproject associated with the tests run.  If there are no subprojects on the
tests, nothing extra is printed.
.sp
See \fI\%Label and Subproject Summary\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-test\-dir <dir>
New in version 3.20.

.sp
Specify the directory in which to look for tests, typically a CMake project
build directory. If not specified, the current directory is used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-test\-output\-size\-passed <size>
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Limit the output for passed tests to \fB<size>\fP bytes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-test\-output\-size\-failed <size>
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Limit the output for failed tests to \fB<size>\fP bytes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-test\-output\-truncation <mode>
New in version 3.24.

.sp
Truncate \fBtail\fP (default), \fBmiddle\fP or \fBhead\fP of test output once
maximum output size is reached.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Overwrite CTest configuration option.
.sp
By default CTest uses configuration options from configuration file.
This option will overwrite the configuration option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-force\-new\-ctest\-process
Run child CTest instances as new processes.
.sp
By default CTest will run child CTest instances within the same
process.  If this behavior is not desired, this argument will
enforce new processes for child CTest processes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-schedule\-random
Use a random order for scheduling tests.
.sp
This option will run the tests in a random order.  It is commonly
used to detect implicit dependencies in a test suite.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-submit\-index
Legacy option for old Dart2 dashboard server feature.
Do not use.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-timeout <seconds>
Set the default test timeout.
.sp
This option effectively sets a timeout on all tests that do not
already have a timeout set on them via the \fI\%TIMEOUT\fP
property.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-stop\-time <time>
Set a time at which all tests should stop running.
.sp
Set a real time of day at which all tests should timeout.  Example:
\fB7:00:00 \-0400\fP\&.  Any time format understood by the curl date parser
is accepted.  Local time is assumed if no timezone is specified.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-print\-labels
Print all available test labels.
.sp
This option will not run any tests, it will simply print the list of
all labels associated with the test set.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-tests=<action>
Regard no tests found either as error (when \fB<action>\fP is set to
\fBerror\fP) or ignore it (when \fB<action>\fP is set to \fBignore\fP).
.sp
If no tests were found, the default behavior of CTest is to always log an
error message but to return an error code in script mode only.  This option
unifies the behavior of CTest by either returning an error code if no tests
were found or by ignoring it.
.sp
New in version 3.26.

.sp
This option can also be set by setting the \fI\%CTEST_NO_TESTS_ACTION\fP
environment variable.

.SH LABEL MATCHING
.sp
Tests may have labels attached to them. Tests may be included
or excluded from a test run by filtering on the labels.
Each individual filter is a regular expression applied to
the labels attached to a test.
.sp
When \fI\%\-L\fP is used, in order for a test to be included in a
test run, each regular expression must match at least one
label.  Using more than one \fI\%\-L\fP option means \(dqmatch \fBall\fP
of these\(dq.
.sp
The \fI\%\-LE\fP option works just like \fI\%\-L\fP,
but excludes tests rather than including them. A test is excluded if each
regular expression matches at least one label.
.sp
If a test has no labels attached to it, then \fI\%\-L\fP will never
include that test, and \fI\%\-LE\fP will never exclude that test.
As an example of tests with labels, consider five tests,
with the following labels:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fItest1\fP has labels \fItuesday\fP and \fIproduction\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fItest2\fP has labels \fItuesday\fP and \fItest\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fItest3\fP has labels \fIwednesday\fP and \fIproduction\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fItest4\fP has label \fIwednesday\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fItest5\fP has labels \fIfriday\fP and \fItest\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Running \fBctest\fP with \fB\-L tuesday \-L test\fP will select \fItest2\fP, which has
both labels. Running CTest with \fB\-L test\fP will select \fItest2\fP and
\fItest5\fP, because both of them have a label that matches that regular
expression.
.sp
Because the matching works with regular expressions, take note that
running CTest with \fB\-L es\fP will match all five tests.
To select the \fItuesday\fP and \fIwednesday\fP tests together, use a single
regular expression that matches either of them, like \fB\-L \(dqtue|wed\(dq\fP\&.
.SH LABEL AND SUBPROJECT SUMMARY
.sp
CTest prints timing summary information for each \fBLABEL\fP and subproject
associated with the tests run. The label time summary will not include labels
that are mapped to subprojects.
.sp
New in version 3.22: Labels added dynamically during test execution are also reported in the
timing summary.  See \fI\%Additional Labels\fP\&.

.sp
When the \fI\%PROCESSORS\fP test property is set, CTest will display a
weighted test timing result in label and subproject summaries. The time is
reported with \fIsec*proc\fP instead of just \fIsec\fP\&.
.sp
The weighted time summary reported for each label or subproject \fBj\fP
is computed as:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Weighted Time Summary for Label/Subproject j =
    sum(raw_test_time[j,i] * num_processors[j,i], i=1...num_tests[j])

for labels/subprojects j=1...total
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBraw_test_time[j,i]\fP: Wall\-clock time for the \fBi\fP test
for the \fBj\fP label or subproject
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnum_processors[j,i]\fP: Value of the CTest \fI\%PROCESSORS\fP property
for the \fBi\fP test for the \fBj\fP label or subproject
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnum_tests[j]\fP: Number of tests associated with the \fBj\fP label or subproject
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtotal\fP: Total number of labels or subprojects that have at least one test run
.UNINDENT
.sp
Therefore, the weighted time summary for each label or subproject represents
the amount of time that CTest gave to run the tests for each label or
subproject and gives a good representation of the total expense of the tests
for each label or subproject when compared to other labels or subprojects.
.sp
For example, if \fBSubprojectA\fP showed \fB100 sec*proc\fP and \fBSubprojectB\fP showed
\fB10 sec*proc\fP, then CTest allocated approximately 10 times the CPU/core time
to run the tests for \fBSubprojectA\fP than for \fBSubprojectB\fP (e.g. so if effort
is going to be expended to reduce the cost of the test suite for the whole
project, then reducing the cost of the test suite for \fBSubprojectA\fP would
likely have a larger impact than effort to reduce the cost of the test suite
for \fBSubprojectB\fP).
.SH BUILD AND TEST MODE
.sp
CTest provides a command\-line signature to configure (i.e. run cmake on),
build, and/or execute a test:

.SS Dashboard Client Modes
.sp
CTest defines three modes of operation as a dashboard client:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBNightly\fP
This mode is intended to be invoked once per day, typically at night.
It enables the \fBStart\fP, \fBUpdate\fP, \fBConfigure\fP, \fBBuild\fP, \fBTest\fP,
\fBCoverage\fP, and \fBSubmit\fP steps by default.  Selected steps run even
if the \fBUpdate\fP step reports no changes to the source tree.
.TP
.B \fBContinuous\fP
This mode is intended to be invoked repeatedly throughout the day.
It enables the \fBStart\fP, \fBUpdate\fP, \fBConfigure\fP, \fBBuild\fP, \fBTest\fP,
\fBCoverage\fP, and \fBSubmit\fP steps by default, but exits after the
\fBUpdate\fP step if it reports no changes to the source tree.
.TP
.B \fBExperimental\fP
This mode is intended to be invoked by a developer to test local changes.
It enables the \fBStart\fP, \fBConfigure\fP, \fBBuild\fP, \fBTest\fP, \fBCoverage\fP,
and \fBSubmit\fP steps by default.
.UNINDENT
.SS Dashboard Client via CTest Command\-Line

.SH RESOURCE ALLOCATION
.sp
CTest provides a mechanism for tests to specify the resources that they need
in a fine\-grained way, and for users to specify the resources available on
the running machine. This allows CTest to internally keep track of which
resources are in use and which are free, scheduling tests in a way that
prevents them from trying to claim resources that are not available.
.sp
When the resource allocation feature is used, CTest will not oversubscribe
resources. For example, if a resource has 8 slots, CTest will not run tests
that collectively use more than 8 slots at a time. This has the effect of
limiting how many tests can run at any given time, even if a high \fB\-j\fP
argument is used, if those tests all use some slots from the same resource.
In addition, it means that a single test that uses more of a resource than is
available on a machine will not run at all (and will be reported as
\fBNot Run\fP).
.sp
A common use case for this feature is for tests that require the use of a GPU.
Multiple tests can simultaneously allocate memory from a GPU, but if too many
tests try to do this at once, some of them will fail to allocate, resulting in
a failed test, even though the test would have succeeded if it had the memory
it needed. By using the resource allocation feature, each test can specify how
much memory it requires from a GPU, allowing CTest to schedule tests in a way
that running several of these tests at once does not exhaust the GPU\(aqs memory
pool.
.sp
Please note that CTest has no concept of what a GPU is or how much memory it
has. It does not have any way of communicating with a GPU to retrieve this
information or perform any memory management, although the project can define
a test that provides details about the test machine (see
\fI\%Dynamically\-Generated Resource Specification File\fP).
.sp
CTest keeps track of a list of abstract resource types, each of which has a
certain number of slots available for tests to use. Each test specifies the
number of slots that it requires from a certain resource, and CTest then
schedules them in a way that prevents the total number of slots in use from
exceeding the listed capacity. When a test is executed, and slots from a
resource are allocated to that test, tests may assume that they have exclusive
use of those slots for the duration of the test\(aqs process.
.sp
The CTest resource allocation feature consists of at least two inputs:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fI\%resource specification file\fP,
described below, which describes the resources available on the system.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fI\%RESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property of tests, which describes the
resources required by the test.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When CTest runs a test, the resources allocated to that test are passed in the
form of a set of
\fI\%environment variables\fP as
described below. Using this information to decide which resource to connect to
is left to the test writer.
.sp
The \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property tells CTest what resources a test expects
to use grouped in a way meaningful to the test.  The test itself must read
the \fI\%environment variables\fP to
determine which resources have been allocated to each group.  For example,
each group may correspond to a process the test will spawn when executed.
.sp
Note that even if a test specifies a \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property, it is still
possible for that to test to run without any resource allocation (and without
the corresponding
\fI\%environment variables\fP)
if the user does not pass a resource specification file. Passing this file,
either through the \fB\-\-resource\-spec\-file\fP command\-line argument or the
\fBRESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP argument to \fI\%ctest_test()\fP, is what activates the
resource allocation feature. Tests should check the
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT\fP environment variable to find out whether or not
resource allocation is activated. This variable will always (and only) be
defined if resource allocation is activated. If resource allocation is not
activated, then the \fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT\fP variable will not exist,
even if it exists for the parent \fBctest\fP process. If a test absolutely must
have resource allocation, then it can return a failing exit code or use the
\fI\%SKIP_RETURN_CODE\fP or \fI\%SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP
properties to indicate a skipped test.
.SS Resource Specification File
.sp
The resource specification file is a JSON file which is passed to CTest in one
of a number of ways. It can be specified on the command line with the
\fI\%ctest \-\-resource\-spec\-file\fP option, it can be given using the
\fBRESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP argument of \fI\%ctest_test()\fP, or it can be
generated dynamically as part of test execution (see
\fI\%Dynamically\-Generated Resource Specification File\fP).
.sp
If a dashboard script is used and \fBRESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP is not specified, the
value of \fI\%CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP in the dashboard script is used
instead.  If \fI\%\-\-resource\-spec\-file\fP,
\fBRESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP, and \fI\%CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP in the
dashboard script are not specified, the value of
\fI\%CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP in the CMake build is used instead.
If none of these are specified, no resource spec file is used.
.sp
The resource specification file must be a JSON object. All examples in this
document assume the following resource specification file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
The members are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBversion\fP
An object containing a \fBmajor\fP integer field and a \fBminor\fP integer field.
Currently, the only supported version is major \fB1\fP, minor \fB0\fP\&. Any other
value is an error.
.TP
.B \fBlocal\fP
A JSON array of resource sets present on the system.  Currently, this array
is restricted to being of size 1.
.sp
Each array element is a JSON object with members whose names are equal to the
desired resource types, such as \fBgpus\fP\&. These names must start with a
lowercase letter or an underscore, and subsequent characters can be a
lowercase letter, a digit, or an underscore. Uppercase letters are not
allowed, because certain platforms have case\-insensitive environment
variables. See the \fI\%Environment Variables\fP section below for
more information. It is recommended that the resource type name be the plural
of a noun, such as \fBgpus\fP or \fBcrypto_chips\fP (and not \fBgpu\fP or
\fBcrypto_chip\fP\&.)
.sp
Please note that the names \fBgpus\fP and \fBcrypto_chips\fP are just examples,
and CTest does not interpret them in any way. You are free to make up any
resource type you want to meet your own requirements.
.sp
The value for each resource type is a JSON array consisting of JSON objects,
each of which describe a specific instance of the specified resource. These
objects have the following members:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBid\fP
A string consisting of an identifier for the resource. Each character in
the identifier can be a lowercase letter, a digit, or an underscore.
Uppercase letters are not allowed.
.sp
Identifiers must be unique within a resource type. However, they do not
have to be unique across resource types. For example, it is valid to have a
\fBgpus\fP resource named \fB0\fP and a \fBcrypto_chips\fP resource named \fB0\fP,
but not two \fBgpus\fP resources both named \fB0\fP\&.
.sp
Please note that the IDs \fB0\fP, \fB1\fP, \fB2\fP, \fB3\fP, and \fBcard0\fP are just
examples, and CTest does not interpret them in any way. You are free to
make up any IDs you want to meet your own requirements.
.TP
.B \fBslots\fP
An optional unsigned number specifying the number of slots available on the
resource. For example, this could be megabytes of RAM on a GPU, or
cryptography units available on a cryptography chip. If \fBslots\fP is not
specified, a default value of \fB1\fP is assumed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the example file above, there are four GPUs with ID\(aqs 0 through 3. GPU 0 has
2 slots, GPU 1 has 4, GPU 2 has 2, and GPU 3 has a default of 1 slot. There is
also one cryptography chip with 4 slots.
.SS \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP Property
.sp
See \fI\%RESOURCE_GROUPS\fP for a description of this property.
.SS Environment Variables
.sp
Once CTest has decided which resources to allocate to a test, it passes this
information to the test executable as a series of environment variables. For
each example below, we will assume that the test in question has a
\fI\%RESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property of
\fB2,gpus:2;gpus:4,gpus:1,crypto_chips:2\fP\&.
.sp
The following variables are passed to the test process:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT
The total number of groups specified by the \fI\%RESOURCE_GROUPS\fP
property. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT=3\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
This variable will only be defined if \fI\%ctest(1)\fP has been given a
\fB\-\-resource\-spec\-file\fP, or if \fI\%ctest_test()\fP has been given a
\fBRESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP\&. If no resource specification file has been given,
this variable will not be defined.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>
The list of resource types allocated to each group, with each item
separated by a comma. \fB<num>\fP is a number from zero to
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT\fP minus one. \fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>\fP
is defined for each \fB<num>\fP in this range. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_0=gpus\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_1=gpus\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_2=crypto_chips,gpus\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>_<resource\-type>
The list of resource IDs and number of slots from each ID allocated to each
group for a given resource type. This variable consists of a series of
pairs, each pair separated by a semicolon, and with the two items in the pair
separated by a comma. The first item in each pair is \fBid:\fP followed by the
ID of a resource of type \fB<resource\-type>\fP, and the second item is
\fBslots:\fP followed by the number of slots from that resource allocated to
the given group. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_0_GPUS=id:0,slots:2\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_1_GPUS=id:2,slots:2\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_2_GPUS=id:1,slots:4;id:3,slots:1\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_2_CRYPTO_CHIPS=id:card0,slots:2\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, group 0 gets 2 slots from GPU \fB0\fP, group 1 gets 2 slots
from GPU \fB2\fP, and group 2 gets 4 slots from GPU \fB1\fP, 1 slot from GPU
\fB3\fP, and 2 slots from cryptography chip \fBcard0\fP\&.
.sp
\fB<num>\fP is a number from zero to \fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT\fP minus one.
\fB<resource\-type>\fP is the name of a resource type, converted to uppercase.
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>_<resource\-type>\fP is defined for the product
of each \fB<num>\fP in the range listed above and each resource type listed in
\fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>\fP\&.
.sp
Because some platforms have case\-insensitive names for environment variables,
the names of resource types may not clash in a case\-insensitive environment.
Because of this, for the sake of simplicity, all resource types must be
listed in all lowercase in the
\fI\%resource specification file\fP and
in the \fI\%RESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property, and they are converted to all
uppercase in the \fBCTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>_<resource\-type>\fP environment
variable.
.UNINDENT
.SS Dynamically\-Generated Resource Specification File
.sp
New in version 3.28.

.sp
A project may optionally specify a single test which will be used to
dynamically generate the resource specification file that CTest will use for
scheduling tests that use resources. The test that generates the file must
have the \fI\%GENERATED_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP property set, and must have
exactly one fixture in its \fI\%FIXTURES_SETUP\fP property. This fixture
is considered by CTest to have special meaning: it\(aqs the fixture that generates
the resource spec file. The fixture may have any name. If such a fixture
exists, all tests that have \fI\%RESOURCE_GROUPS\fP set must have the
fixture in their \fI\%FIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP, and a resource spec file may
not be specified with the \fB\-\-resource\-spec\-file\fP argument or the
\fI\%CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE\fP variable.
.SH JOB SERVER INTEGRATION
.sp
New in version 3.29.

.sp
On POSIX systems, when running under the context of a \fI\%Job Server\fP,
CTest shares its job slots.  This is independent of the \fI\%PROCESSORS\fP
test property, which still counts against CTest\(aqs \fI\%\-j\fP
parallel level.  CTest acquires exactly one token from the job server before
running each test, and returns it when the test finishes.
.sp
For example, consider the \fBMakefile\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
test:
	+ctest \-j 8

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When invoked via \fBmake \-j 2 test\fP, \fBctest\fP connects to the job server,
acquires a token for each test, and runs at most 2 tests concurrently.
.sp
On Windows systems, job server integration is not yet implemented.
