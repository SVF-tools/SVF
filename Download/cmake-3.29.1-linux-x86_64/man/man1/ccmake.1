.SH NAME
ccmake \- CMake Curses Dialog Command-Line Reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ccmake [<options>] \-B <path\-to\-build> [\-S <path\-to\-source>]
ccmake [<options>] <path\-to\-source | path\-to\-existing\-build>
.ft P

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBccmake\fP executable is the CMake curses interface.  Project
configuration settings may be specified interactively through this
GUI.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal
when the program is running.
.sp
CMake is a cross\-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform\-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP\&.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S <path\-to\-source>
Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-B <path\-to\-build>
Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.
.sp
If the directory doesn\(aqt already exist CMake will make it.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C <initial\-cache>
Pre\-load a script to populate the cache.
.sp
When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
\fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file and populates it with customizable settings for
the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which
to load cache entries before the first pass through the project\(aqs
CMake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the
project\(aqs default values.  The given file should be a CMake script
containing \fI\%set()\fP commands that use the \fBCACHE\fP option, not a
cache\-format file.
.sp
References to \fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP and \fI\%CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP
within the script evaluate to the top\-level source and build tree.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D <var>:<type>=<value>, \-D <var>=<value>
Create or update a CMake \fBCACHE\fP entry.
.sp
When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
\fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file and populates it with customizable settings for
the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that
takes priority over the project\(aqs default value.  The option may be
repeated for as many \fBCACHE\fP entries as desired.
.sp
If the \fB:<type>\fP portion is given it must be one of the types
specified by the \fI\%set()\fP command documentation for its
\fBCACHE\fP signature.
If the \fB:<type>\fP portion is omitted the entry will be created
with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a
command in the project sets the type to \fBPATH\fP or \fBFILEPATH\fP
then the \fB<value>\fP will be converted to an absolute path.
.sp
This option may also be given as a single argument:
\fB\-D<var>:<type>=<value>\fP or \fB\-D<var>=<value>\fP\&.
.sp
It\(aqs important to note that the order of \fB\-C\fP and \fB\-D\fP arguments is
significant. They will be carried out in the order they are listed, with the
last argument taking precedence over the previous ones. For example, if you
specify \fB\-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\fP, followed by a \fB\-C\fP argument with a
file that calls:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE \(dqRelease\(dq CACHE STRING \(dq\(dq FORCE)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
then the \fB\-C\fP argument will take precedence, and \fBCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\fP will
be set to \fBRelease\fP\&. However, if the \fB\-D\fP argument comes after the \fB\-C\fP
argument, it will be set to \fBDebug\fP\&.
.sp
If a \fBset(... CACHE ...)\fP call in the \fB\-C\fP file does not use \fBFORCE\fP,
and a \fB\-D\fP argument sets the same variable, the \fB\-D\fP argument will take
precedence regardless of order because of the nature of non\-\fBFORCE\fP
\fBset(... CACHE ...)\fP calls.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-U <globbing_expr>
Remove matching entries from CMake \fBCACHE\fP\&.
.sp
This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the
\fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file, globbing expressions using \fB*\fP and \fB?\fP are
supported.  The option may be repeated for as many \fBCACHE\fP entries as
desired.
.sp
Use with care, you can make your \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP non\-working.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-G <generator\-name>
Specify a build system generator.
.sp
CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain
platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating a particular
build system.  Possible generator names are specified in the
\fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP manual.
.sp
If not specified, CMake checks the \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR\fP environment
variable and otherwise falls back to a builtin default selection.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-T <toolset\-spec>
Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.
.sp
Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell
the native build system how to choose a compiler.  See the
\fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP variable for details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-A <platform\-name>
Specify platform name if supported by generator.
.sp
Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the
native build system to choose a compiler or SDK.  See the
\fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP variable for details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-toolchain <path\-to\-file>
