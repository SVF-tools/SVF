.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBcmake\fP executable is the command\-line interface of the cross\-platform
buildsystem generator CMake.  The above \fI\%Synopsis\fP lists various actions
the tool can perform as described in sections below.
.sp
To build a software project with CMake, \fI\%Generate a Project Buildsystem\fP\&.
Optionally use \fBcmake\fP to \fI\%Build a Project\fP, \fI\%Install a Project\fP or just
run the corresponding build tool (e.g. \fBmake\fP) directly.  \fBcmake\fP can also
be used to \fI\%View Help\fP\&.
.sp
The other actions are meant for use by software developers writing
scripts in the \fI\%CMake language\fP to support
their builds.
.sp
For graphical user interfaces that may be used in place of \fBcmake\fP,
see \fI\%ccmake\fP and \fI\%cmake\-gui\fP\&.
For command\-line interfaces to the CMake testing and packaging facilities,
see \fI\%ctest\fP and \fI\%cpack\fP\&.
.sp
For more information on CMake at large, \fI\%see also\fP the links at the end
of this manual.
.SH INTRODUCTION TO CMAKE BUILDSYSTEMS
.sp
A \fIbuildsystem\fP describes how to build a project\(aqs executables and libraries
from its source code using a \fIbuild tool\fP to automate the process.  For
example, a buildsystem may be a \fBMakefile\fP for use with a command\-line
\fBmake\fP tool or a project file for an Integrated Development Environment
(IDE).  In order to avoid maintaining multiple such buildsystems, a project
may specify its buildsystem abstractly using files written in the
\fI\%CMake language\fP\&.  From these files CMake
generates a preferred buildsystem locally for each user through a backend
called a \fIgenerator\fP\&.
.sp
To generate a buildsystem with CMake, the following must be selected:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Source Tree
The top\-level directory containing source files provided by the project.
The project specifies its buildsystem using files as described in the
\fI\%cmake\-language(7)\fP manual, starting with a top\-level file named
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP\&.  These files specify build targets and their
dependencies as described in the \fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual.
.TP
.B Build Tree
The top\-level directory in which buildsystem files and build output
artifacts (e.g. executables and libraries) are to be stored.
CMake will write a \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file to identify the directory
as a build tree and store persistent information such as buildsystem
configuration options.
.sp
To maintain a pristine source tree, perform an \fIout\-of\-source\fP build
by using a separate dedicated build tree.  An \fIin\-source\fP build in
which the build tree is placed in the same directory as the source
tree is also supported, but discouraged.
.TP
.B Generator
This chooses the kind of buildsystem to generate.  See the
\fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP manual for documentation of all generators.
Run \fI\%cmake \-\-help\fP to see a list of generators available locally.
Optionally use the \fI\%\-G\fP option below to specify a
generator, or simply accept the default CMake chooses for the current
platform.
.sp
When using one of the \fI\%Command\-Line Build Tool Generators\fP
CMake expects that the environment needed by the compiler toolchain
is already configured in the shell.  When using one of the
\fI\%IDE Build Tool Generators\fP, no particular environment is needed.
.UNINDENT
.SH GENERATE A PROJECT BUILDSYSTEM
.sp
Run CMake with one of the following command signatures to specify the
source and build trees and generate a buildsystem:
.sp
\fBcmake [<options>] \-B <path\-to\-build> [\-S <path\-to\-source>]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
New in version 3.13.

.sp
Uses \fB<path\-to\-build>\fP as the build tree and \fB<path\-to\-source>\fP
as the source tree.  The specified paths may be absolute or relative
to the current working directory.  The source tree must contain a
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file.  The build tree will be created automatically
if it does not already exist.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cmake \-S src \-B build
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcmake [<options>] <path\-to\-source>\fP
Uses the current working directory as the build tree, and
\fB<path\-to\-source>\fP as the source tree.  The specified path may
be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
The source tree must contain a \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file and must
\fInot\fP contain a \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file because the latter
identifies an existing build tree.  For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ mkdir build ; cd build
$ cmake ../src
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBcmake [<options>] <path\-to\-existing\-build>\fP
Uses \fB<path\-to\-existing\-build>\fP as the build tree, and loads the
path to the source tree from its \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file, which must
have already been generated by a previous run of CMake.  The specified
path may be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cd build
$ cmake .
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In all cases the \fB<options>\fP may be zero or more of the \fI\%Options\fP below.
.sp
The above styles for specifying the source and build trees may be mixed.
Paths specified with \fI\%\-S\fP or \fI\%\-B\fP
are always classified as source or build trees, respectively.  Paths
specified with plain arguments are classified based on their content
and the types of paths given earlier.  If only one type of path is given,
the current working directory (cwd) is used for the other.  For example:
.TS
center;
|l|l|l|.

.TE
.sp
Changed in version 3.23: CMake warns when multiple source paths are specified.  This has never
been officially documented or supported, but older versions accidentally
accepted multiple source paths and used the last path specified.
Avoid passing multiple source path arguments.

.sp
After generating a buildsystem one may use the corresponding native
build tool to build the project.  For example, after using the
\fI\%Unix Makefiles\fP generator one may run \fBmake\fP directly:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ make
$ make install
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, one may use \fBcmake\fP to \fI\%Build a Project\fP by
automatically choosing and invoking the appropriate native build tool.
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S <path\-to\-source>
Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-B <path\-to\-build>
Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.
.sp
If the directory doesn\(aqt already exist CMake will make it.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C <initial\-cache>
Pre\-load a script to populate the cache.
.sp
When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
\fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file and populates it with customizable settings for
the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which
to load cache entries before the first pass through the project\(aqs
CMake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the
project\(aqs default values.  The given file should be a CMake script
containing \fI\%set()\fP commands that use the \fBCACHE\fP option, not a
cache\-format file.
.sp
References to \fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP and \fI\%CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP
within the script evaluate to the top\-level source and build tree.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D <var>:<type>=<value>, \-D <var>=<value>
Create or update a CMake \fBCACHE\fP entry.
.sp
When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
\fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file and populates it with customizable settings for
the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that
takes priority over the project\(aqs default value.  The option may be
repeated for as many \fBCACHE\fP entries as desired.
.sp
If the \fB:<type>\fP portion is given it must be one of the types
specified by the \fI\%set()\fP command documentation for its
\fBCACHE\fP signature.
If the \fB:<type>\fP portion is omitted the entry will be created
with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a
command in the project sets the type to \fBPATH\fP or \fBFILEPATH\fP
then the \fB<value>\fP will be converted to an absolute path.
.sp
This option may also be given as a single argument:
\fB\-D<var>:<type>=<value>\fP or \fB\-D<var>=<value>\fP\&.
.sp
It\(aqs important to note that the order of \fB\-C\fP and \fB\-D\fP arguments is
significant. They will be carried out in the order they are listed, with the
last argument taking precedence over the previous ones. For example, if you
specify \fB\-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\fP, followed by a \fB\-C\fP argument with a
file that calls:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE \(dqRelease\(dq CACHE STRING \(dq\(dq FORCE)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
then the \fB\-C\fP argument will take precedence, and \fBCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\fP will
be set to \fBRelease\fP\&. However, if the \fB\-D\fP argument comes after the \fB\-C\fP
argument, it will be set to \fBDebug\fP\&.
.sp
If a \fBset(... CACHE ...)\fP call in the \fB\-C\fP file does not use \fBFORCE\fP,
and a \fB\-D\fP argument sets the same variable, the \fB\-D\fP argument will take
precedence regardless of order because of the nature of non\-\fBFORCE\fP
\fBset(... CACHE ...)\fP calls.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-U <globbing_expr>
Remove matching entries from CMake \fBCACHE\fP\&.
.sp
This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the
\fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file, globbing expressions using \fB*\fP and \fB?\fP are
supported.  The option may be repeated for as many \fBCACHE\fP entries as
desired.
.sp
Use with care, you can make your \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP non\-working.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-G <generator\-name>
Specify a build system generator.
.sp
CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain
platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating a particular
build system.  Possible generator names are specified in the
\fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP manual.
.sp
If not specified, CMake checks the \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR\fP environment
variable and otherwise falls back to a builtin default selection.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-T <toolset\-spec>
Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.
.sp
Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell
the native build system how to choose a compiler.  See the
\fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP variable for details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-A <platform\-name>
Specify platform name if supported by generator.
.sp
Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the
native build system to choose a compiler or SDK.  See the
\fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP variable for details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-toolchain <path\-to\-file>
New in version 3.21.

.sp
Specify the cross compiling toolchain file, equivalent to setting
\fI\%CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\fP variable.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-install\-prefix <directory>
New in version 3.21.

.sp
Specify the installation directory, used by the
\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP variable. Must be an absolute path.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Wno\-dev

.sp
Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP files. By default this will also turn off
deprecation warnings.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Wdev
Enable developer warnings.
.sp
Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP
files. By default this will also turn on deprecation warnings.
.UNINDENT

.B \-Wdeprecated
Enable deprecated functionality warnings.
.sp
Enable warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
for the author of the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Wno\-deprecated
Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.
.sp
Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
for the author of the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Werror=<what>
Treat CMake warnings as errors. \fB<what>\fP must be one of the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBdev\fP
Make developer warnings errors.
.sp
Make warnings that are meant for the author of the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP files
errors. By default this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors.
.TP
.B \fBdeprecated\fP
Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.
.sp
Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant
for the author of the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP files, errors.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Wno\-error=<what>
Do not treat CMake warnings as errors. \fB<what>\fP must be one of the following:
.INDENT 7.0

for the author of the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP files, not errors.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fresh
New in version 3.24.

.sp
Perform a fresh configuration of the build tree.
This removes any existing \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file and associated
\fBCMakeFiles/\fP directory, and recreates them from scratch.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L[A][H]
List non\-advanced cached variables.
.sp
List \fBCACHE\fP variables will run CMake and list all the variables from
the CMake \fBCACHE\fP that are not marked as \fBINTERNAL\fP or \fI\%ADVANCED\fP\&.
This will effectively display current CMake settings, which can then be
changed with \fI\%\-D\fP option.  Changing some of the variables
may result in more variables being created.  If \fBA\fP is specified, then it
will display also advanced variables.  If \fBH\fP is specified, it will also
display help for each variable.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N
View mode only.
.sp
Only load the cache.  Do not actually run configure and generate
steps.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-graphviz=<file>
Generate graphviz of dependencies, see \fI\%CMakeGraphVizOptions\fP for more.
.sp
Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the library and
executable dependencies in the project.  See the documentation for
\fI\%CMakeGraphVizOptions\fP for more details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-system\-information [file]
Dump information about this system.
.sp
Dump a wide range of information about the current system.  If run
from the top of a binary tree for a CMake project it will dump
additional information such as the cache, log files etc.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-log\-level=<level>
Set the log \fB<level>\fP\&.
.sp
The \fI\%message()\fP command will only output messages of the specified
log level or higher.  The valid log levels are \fBERROR\fP, \fBWARNING\fP,
\fBNOTICE\fP, \fBSTATUS\fP (default), \fBVERBOSE\fP, \fBDEBUG\fP, or \fBTRACE\fP\&.
.sp
To make a log level persist between CMake runs, set
\fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL\fP as a cache variable instead.
If both the command line option and the variable are given, the command line
option takes precedence.
.sp
For backward compatibility reasons, \fB\-\-loglevel\fP is also accepted as a
synonym for this option.
.sp
New in version 3.25: See the \fI\%cmake_language()\fP command for a way to
\fI\%query the current message logging level\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-log\-context
Enable the \fI\%message()\fP command outputting context attached to each
message.
.sp
This option turns on showing context for the current CMake run only.
To make showing the context persistent for all subsequent CMake runs, set
\fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW\fP as a cache variable instead.
When this command line option is given, \fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW\fP
is ignored.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-debug\-trycompile
Do not delete the files and directories created for
\fI\%try_compile()\fP / \fI\%try_run()\fP calls.
This is useful in debugging failed checks.
.sp
Note that some uses of \fI\%try_compile()\fP may use the same build tree,
which will limit the usefulness of this option if a project executes more
than one \fI\%try_compile()\fP\&.  For example, such uses may change results
as artifacts from a previous try\-compile may cause a different test to either
pass or fail incorrectly.  This option is best used only when debugging.
.sp
(With respect to the preceding, the \fI\%try_run()\fP command
is effectively a \fI\%try_compile()\fP\&.  Any combination of the two
is subject to the potential issues described.)
.sp
New in version 3.25: When this option is enabled, every try\-compile check prints a log
message reporting the directory in which the check is performed.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

The presets are read before all other command line options. The options
specified by the preset (variables, generator, etc.) can all be overridden by
manually specifying them on the command line. For example, if the preset sets
a variable called \fBMYVAR\fP to \fB1\fP, but the user sets it to \fB2\fP with a

.B remove [\-f] <file>...
Deprecated since version 3.17.

.sp
Remove the file(s). The planned behavior was that if any of the
listed files already do not exist, the command returns a non\-zero exit code,
but no message is logged. The \fB\-f\fP option changes the behavior to return a
zero exit code (i.e. success) in such situations instead.
\fBremove\fP does not follow symlinks. That means it remove only symlinks
and not files it point to.
.sp
The implementation was buggy and always returned 0. It cannot be fixed without
breaking backwards compatibility. Use \fBrm\fP instead.

.B rm [\-rRf] [\-\-] <file|dir>...
New in version 3.17.

.sp
Remove the files \fB<file>\fP or directories \fB<dir>\fP\&.
Use \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-R\fP to remove directories and their contents recursively.
If any of the listed files/directories do not exist, the command returns a
non\-zero exit code, but no message is logged. The \fB\-f\fP option changes
the behavior to return a zero exit code (i.e. success) in such
situations instead. Use \fB\-\-\fP to stop interpreting options and treat all
remaining arguments as paths, even if they start with \fB\-\fP\&.
