.SH NAME
cmake-file-api \- CMake File-Based API
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
CMake provides a file\-based API that clients may use to get semantic
information about the buildsystems CMake generates.  Clients may use
the API by writing query files to a specific location in a build tree
to request zero or more \fI\%Object Kinds\fP\&.  When CMake generates the
buildsystem in that build tree it will read the query files and write
reply files for the client to read.
.sp
The file\-based API uses a \fB<build>/.cmake/api/\fP directory at the top
of a build tree.  The API is versioned to support changes to the layout
of files within the API directory.  API file layout versioning is
orthogonal to the versioning of \fI\%Object Kinds\fP used in replies.
This version of CMake supports only one API version, \fI\%API v1\fP\&.
.sp
New in version 3.27: Projects may also submit queries for the current run using the
\fI\%cmake_file_api()\fP command.

.SH API V1
.sp
API v1 is housed in the \fB<build>/.cmake/api/v1/\fP directory.
It has the following subdirectories:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBquery/\fP
Holds query files written by clients.
These may be \fI\%v1 Shared Stateless Query Files\fP,
\fI\%v1 Client Stateless Query Files\fP, or \fI\%v1 Client Stateful Query Files\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBreply/\fP
Holds reply files written by CMake whenever it runs to generate a build
system.  These are indexed by a \fI\%v1 Reply Index File\fP file that may
reference additional \fI\%v1 Reply Files\fP\&.  CMake owns all reply files.
Clients must never remove them.
.sp
Clients may look for and read a reply index file at any time.
Clients may optionally create the \fBreply/\fP directory at any time
and monitor it for the appearance of a new reply index file.
.UNINDENT
.SS v1 Shared Stateless Query Files
.sp
Shared stateless query files allow clients to share requests for
major versions of the \fI\%Object Kinds\fP and get all requested versions
recognized by the CMake that runs.
.sp
Clients may create shared requests by creating empty files in the
\fBv1/query/\fP directory.  The form is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<build>/.cmake/api/v1/query/<kind>\-v<major>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fB<kind>\fP is one of the \fI\%Object Kinds\fP, \fB\-v\fP is literal,
and \fB<major>\fP is the major version number.
.sp
Files of this form are stateless shared queries not owned by any specific
client.  Once created they should not be removed without external client
coordination or human intervention.
.SS v1 Client Stateless Query Files
.sp
Client stateless query files allow clients to create owned requests for
major versions of the \fI\%Object Kinds\fP and get all requested versions
recognized by the CMake that runs.
.sp
Clients may create owned requests by creating empty files in
client\-specific query subdirectories.  The form is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<build>/.cmake/api/v1/query/client\-<client>/<kind>\-v<major>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBclient\-\fP is literal, \fB<client>\fP is a string uniquely
identifying the client, \fB<kind>\fP is one of the \fI\%Object Kinds\fP,
\fB\-v\fP is literal, and \fB<major>\fP is the major version number.
Each client must choose a unique \fB<client>\fP identifier via its
own means.
.sp
Files of this form are stateless queries owned by the client \fB<client>\fP\&.
The owning client may remove them at any time.
.SS v1 Client Stateful Query Files
.sp
Stateful query files allow clients to request a list of versions of
each of the \fI\%Object Kinds\fP and get only the most recent version
recognized by the CMake that runs.
.sp
Clients may create owned stateful queries by creating \fBquery.json\fP
files in client\-specific query subdirectories.  The form is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<build>/.cmake/api/v1/query/client\-<client>/query.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBclient\-\fP is literal, \fB<client>\fP is a string uniquely
identifying the client, and \fBquery.json\fP is literal.  Each client
must choose a unique \fB<client>\fP identifier via its own means.
.sp
\fBquery.json\fP files are stateful queries owned by the client \fB<client>\fP\&.
The owning client may update or remove them at any time.  When a
given client installation is updated it may then update the stateful
query it writes to build trees to request newer object versions.
This can be used to avoid asking CMake to generate multiple object
versions unnecessarily.
.sp
A \fBquery.json\fP file must contain a JSON object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
  \(dqrequests\(dq: [
    { \(dqkind\(dq: \(dq<kind>\(dq , \(dqversion\(dq: 1 },

.TP
.B \fBrequests\fP
A JSON array containing zero or more requests.  Each request is
a JSON object with members:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBkind\fP
Specifies one of the \fI\%Object Kinds\fP to be included in the reply.
.TP
.B \fBversion\fP
Indicates the version(s) of the object kind that the client
understands.  Versions have major and minor components following
semantic version conventions.  The value must be
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
a JSON integer specifying a (non\-negative) major version number, or
.IP \(bu 2
a JSON object containing \fBmajor\fP and (optionally) \fBminor\fP
members specifying non\-negative integer version components, or
.IP \(bu 2
a JSON array whose elements are each one of the above.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBclient\fP
Optional member reserved for use by the client.  This value is
preserved in the reply written for the client in the
\fI\%v1 Reply Index File\fP but is otherwise ignored.  Clients may use
this to pass custom information with a request through to its reply.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For each requested object kind CMake will choose the \fIfirst\fP version
that it recognizes for that kind among those listed in the request.
The response will use the selected \fImajor\fP version with the highest
\fIminor\fP version known to the running CMake for that major version.
Therefore clients should list all supported major versions in
preferred order along with the minimal minor version required
for each major version.
.TP
.B \fBclient\fP
Optional member reserved for use by the client.  This value is
preserved in the reply written for the client in the
\fI\%v1 Reply Index File\fP but is otherwise ignored.  Clients may use
this to pass custom information with a query through to its reply.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other \fBquery.json\fP top\-level members are reserved for future use.
If present they are ignored for forward compatibility.
.SS v1 Reply Index File
.sp
CMake writes an \fBindex\-*.json\fP file to the \fBv1/reply/\fP directory
whenever it runs to generate a build system.  Clients must read the
reply index file first and may read other \fI\%v1 Reply Files\fP only by
following references.  The form of the reply index file name is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<build>/.cmake/api/v1/reply/index\-<unspecified>.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBindex\-\fP is literal and \fB<unspecified>\fP is an unspecified
name selected by CMake.  Whenever a new index file is generated it
is given a new name and any old one is deleted.  During the short
time between these steps there may be multiple index files present;
the one with the largest name in lexicographic order is the current
index file.
.sp
The reply index file contains a JSON object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

After reading the reply index file, clients may read the other
\fI\%v1 Reply Files\fP it references.
.SS v1 Reply File Reference
.sp
The reply index file represents each reference to another reply file
using a JSON object with members:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBkind\fP
A string specifying one of the \fI\%Object Kinds\fP\&.

A JSON string specifying a path relative to the reply index file
to another JSON file containing the object.
.UNINDENT
.SS v1 Reply Files
.sp
Reply files containing specific \fI\%Object Kinds\fP are written by CMake.
The names of these files are unspecified and must not be interpreted
by clients.  Clients must first read the \fI\%v1 Reply Index File\fP and
follow references to the names of the desired response objects.
.sp
Reply files (including the index file) will never be replaced by
files of the same name but different content.  This allows a client
to read the files concurrently with a running CMake that may generate
a new reply.  However, after generating a new reply CMake will attempt
to remove reply files from previous runs that it did not just write.
If a client attempts to read a reply file referenced by the index but
finds the file missing, that means a concurrent CMake has generated
a new reply.  The client may simply start again by reading the new
reply index file.
.SH OBJECT KINDS
.sp
The CMake file\-based API reports semantic information about the build
system using the following kinds of JSON objects.  Each kind of object
is versioned independently using semantic versioning with major and
minor components.  Every kind of object has the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
  \(dqkind\(dq: \(dq<kind>\(dq,
  \(dqversion\(dq: { \(dqmajor\(dq: 1, \(dqminor\(dq: 0 },
  \(dq...\(dq: {}
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBkind\fP member is a string specifying the object kind name.
The \fBversion\fP member is a JSON object with \fBmajor\fP and \fBminor\fP
members specifying integer components of the object kind\(aqs version.
Additional top\-level members are specific to each object kind.
.SS Object Kind \(dqcodemodel\(dq
.sp
The \fBcodemodel\fP object kind describes the build system structure as
modeled by CMake.
.sp
There is only one \fBcodemodel\fP object major version, version 2.
Version 1 does not exist to avoid confusion with that from
\fI\%cmake\-server(7)\fP mode.
.SS \(dqcodemodel\(dq version 2
