.SH NAME
cmake-policies \- CMake Policies Reference
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
Policies in CMake are used to preserve backward compatible behavior
across multiple releases.  When a new policy is introduced, newer CMake
versions will begin to warn about the backward compatible behavior.  It
is possible to disable the warning by explicitly requesting the OLD, or
backward compatible behavior using the \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP command.
It is also possible to request \fBNEW\fP, or non\-backward compatible behavior
for a policy, also avoiding the warning.  Each policy can also be set to
either \fBNEW\fP or \fBOLD\fP behavior explicitly on the command line with the
\fI\%CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>\fP variable.
.sp
A policy is a deprecation mechanism and not a reliable feature toggle.
A policy should almost never be set to \fBOLD\fP, except to silence warnings
in an otherwise frozen or stable codebase, or temporarily as part of a
larger migration path. The \fBOLD\fP behavior of each policy is undesirable
and will be replaced with an error condition in a future release.
.sp
The \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP command does more than report an
error if a too\-old version of CMake is used to build a project.  It
also sets all policies introduced in that CMake version or earlier to
\fBNEW\fP behavior.  To manage policies without increasing the minimum required
CMake version, the \fI\%if(POLICY)\fP command may be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if(POLICY CMP0990)
  cmake_policy(SET CMP0990 NEW)
endif()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This has the effect of using the \fBNEW\fP behavior with newer CMake releases which
users may be using and not issuing a compatibility warning.
.sp
The setting of a policy is confined in some cases to not propagate to the
parent scope.  For example, if the files read by the \fI\%include()\fP command
or the \fI\%find_package()\fP command contain a use of \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP,
that policy setting will not affect the caller by default.  Both commands accept
an optional \fBNO_POLICY_SCOPE\fP keyword to control this behavior.
.sp
The \fI\%CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION\fP variable may also be used
to determine whether to report an error on use of deprecated macros or
functions.
.SH POLICIES INTRODUCED BY CMAKE 3.29
.SS CMP0161
.sp
New in version 3.29.

.sp
The \fI\%CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS\fP variable defaults to true.
.sp
Before CMake 3.29, the \fI\%CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS\fP variable is
unset by default.  When using the \fI\%CPack productbuild Generator\fP,
this disables the use of the \fBdomains\fP attribute in the productbuild
Distribution XML, and falls back to the \fBauth\fP attribute instead.
These attributes control where a productbuild package is allowed to be
installed.  But the \fBauth\fP attribute has been deprecated by Apple,
so projects should migrate to using \fBdomains\fP instead.
.sp
CMake 3.29 and above prefer to use a default value of true for
\fI\%CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS\fP, which means \fBdomains\fP will be used
by default unless the project explicitly sets
\fI\%CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS\fP to false.
This policy provides compatibility with projects that enabled the
\fI\%CPack productbuild Generator\fP, but did not explicitly set
\fI\%CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to leave
\fI\%CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS\fP unset if it hasn\(aqt been set.
The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy is to use a default value of true for
\fI\%CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS\fP\&.
.sp
This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.29\&.
It may be set by \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP or \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP\&.
If it is not set, CMake warns, and uses \fBOLD\fP behavior.
.sp
Note that a warning will only be emitted if the
\fI\%CPACK_BINARY_PRODUCTBUILD\fP variable is
set to true and the project is being built for an Apple platform.

.sp
More read\-only target properties now error when trying to set them.
.sp
The \fI\%set_target_properties()\fP and \fI\%set_property()\fP commands
are intended to error out on all read\-only properties. However, CMake 3.28 and
below only did this for the following properties:
.INDENT 0.0

The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to only error out for the properties
\fI\%MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES\fP, \fI\%NAME\fP, and \fI\%TYPE\fP\&.
The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy is to error out on all target properties
that are documented as read\-only.

\fI\%file(STRINGS)\fP with \fBREGEX\fP updates \fI\%CMAKE_MATCH_<n>\fP\&.
.sp
In CMake 3.28 and below the \fI\%file(STRINGS)\fP command\(aqs \fBREGEX\fP
option does not affect \fI\%CMAKE_MATCH_<n>\fP variables.  CMake 3.29
and above prefer to update the \fI\%CMAKE_MATCH_<n>\fP variables using
captures from the last match in the file, similar to the
\fI\%string(REGEX MATCHALL)\fP command.  This policy provides
compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the behavior.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is for \fI\%file(STRINGS)\fP with
\fBREGEX\fP to not store capture groups in \fI\%CMAKE_MATCH_<n>\fP
variables.  The \fBNEW\fP behavior is to store the capture groups.
.sp
This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.29\&.
It may be set by \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP or \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP\&.

\fI\%add_test()\fP honors \fI\%CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP only
when \fI\%cross\-compiling\fP\&.
.sp
In CMake 3.28 and below, \fI\%add_test()\fP unconditionally used the
\fI\%CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP target property (initialized by the
\fI\%CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP variable) to run test commands
naming executable targets.  CMake 3.29 and above prefer to use the emulator
only when the \fI\%CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING\fP variable is enabled.  The
\fI\%CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER\fP variable may be used instead when not
cross\-compiling.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that
have not been updated.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is for \fI\%add_test()\fP to use
the \fI\%CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP target property unconditionally.
The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy is for \fI\%add_test()\fP to use
the \fI\%CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP target property only when

.sp
Swift compilation mode is selected by an abstraction.
.sp
The Swift compiler can compile modules in different modes. The desired build
mode depends whether the developer is iterating and wants to incrementally make
changes, or if they are building a release for distribution and want more
optimizations applied to the resulting binary.
.sp
CMake versions 3.26 through 3.28 build Swift binaries with whole\-module
optimizations enabled when configured in a non\-debug build type.
For CMake versions earlier than 3.26, the developer needs to specify
the necessary flag manually for the \fI\%Ninja Generators\fP, and cannot
not specify whole\-module optimizations to the \fI\%Xcode\fP generator.
.sp
CMake versions 3.29 and above prefer to set the compilation mode using
the \fI\%Swift_COMPILATION_MODE\fP target property, which can be
initialized by the \fI\%CMAKE_Swift_COMPILATION_MODE\fP variable.
.sp
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated.
The policy setting takes effect as of the first \fI\%project()\fP or
\fI\%enable_language()\fP command that enables the \fBSwift\fP language.

The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy builds all Swift targets in
\fBwholemodule\fP mode for non\-debug configurations.  \fI\%Ninja Generators\fP
prepend the \fB\-wmo\fP flag to the default set of Swift flags.
The \fI\%Xcode\fP generator sets the \fBSWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE\fP
attribute to \fBwholemodule\fP in the generated Xcode project file.
.sp
The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy is to apply the compilation mode specified
in the \fI\%Swift_COMPILATION_MODE\fP target property, initialized as each
target is created by the \fI\%CMAKE_Swift_COMPILATION_MODE\fP variable.

.sp
New in version 3.29.

.sp
De\-duplicate libraries on link lines based on linker capabilities.
.sp
Traditional linkers maintain a set of undefined symbols during linking. The
linker processes each file in the order in which it appears on the command
line, until the set of undefined symbols becomes empty. An object file is
linked into the output object when it is encountered, with its undefined
symbols added to the set. Upon encountering an archive file a traditional
linker searches the objects contained therein, and processes those that satisfy
symbols in the unresolved set.
.sp
Handling mutually dependent archives may be awkward when using a traditional
linker. Archive files may have to be specified multiple times.
.sp
Some linkers (for instance Apple or Windows linkers, as well as \fBLLVM LLD\fP)
record all symbols found in objects and archives as they iterate over command
line arguments. When one of these linkers encounters an undefined symbol that
can be resolved by an object file contained in a previously processed archive
file, it immediately extracts and links it into the output object.
.sp
CMake 3.28 and below may generate link lines that repeat static libraries as
a traditional linker would need, even when using a linker that does not need it.
They may also de\-duplicate shared libraries by keeping their last occurrence,
which on Windows platforms can change DLL load order.
.sp
CMake 3.29 and above prefer to apply different strategies based on linker
capabilities.  So, when targeting Apple and Windows platforms, all
libraries are de\-duplicated.  Moreover, on Windows platforms, libraries
are de\-duplicated by keeping their first occurrence, thus respecting the
project\-specified order.  This policy provides compatibility with projects
that have not been updated to expect the latter behavior.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to always repeat static libraries
as if using a traditional linker, and always de\-duplicate shared libraries
by keeping the last occurrence of each.  The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy
is to apply different strategies based on linker capabilities.
.sp
This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.29\&.
It may be set by \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP or \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP\&.

.sp
C++ sources in targets with at least C++20 are scanned for imports
when supported.
.sp
CMake 3.27 and below assume that C++ sources do not \fBimport\fP modules.
CMake 3.28 and above prefer to assume that C++ sources in targets using C++20
or higher might \fBimport\fP modules, and must be scanned before compiling,
unless explicitly disabled.  This policy provides compatibility for projects
that use C++20 or higher, without modules, that have not been updated to turn
off scanning, e.g., via the \fI\%CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES\fP variable.
See the \fI\%cmake\-cxxmodules(7)\fP manual for more details on C++ module
support.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to assume that C++ 20 and newer
sources do not import modules.  The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy is to
assume that C++ 20 and newer files may import modules if the compiler
understands how to scan for their dependencies, and need to be scanned.
.sp
This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.28\&.
It may be set by \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP or \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP\&.

.sp
New in version 3.28.

.sp
Generated files are private by default in targets using \fI\%File Sets\fP\&.
.sp
CMake 3.27 and below assume that any file generated as an output or byproduct
of \fI\%add_custom_command()\fP or \fI\%add_custom_target()\fP may be a
public header file meant for inclusion by dependents\(aq source files.  This
requires \fI\%Ninja Generators\fP to add conservative order\-only dependencies
that prevent a target\(aqs source files from compiling before custom commands
from the target\(aqs dependencies are finished, even if those custom commands
only produce sources private to their own target.
.sp
\fI\%File Sets\fP, introduced by CMake 3.23, provide a way to express the
visibility of generated header files.  CMake 3.28 and above prefer to
assume that, in targets using file sets, generated files are private to
their own target by default.  Generated public headers must be specified
as members of a \fBPUBLIC\fP (or \fBINTERFACE\fP) \fBFILE_SET\fP, typically of
type \fBHEADERS\fP\&.  With this information, \fI\%Ninja Generators\fP may omit
the above\-mentioned conservative dependencies and produce more efficient
build graphs.
.sp
Additionally, if the custom command\(aqs output is a member of a file set of type
\fBCXX_MODULES\fP, it will additionally not be required to exist before
compiling other sources in the same target.  Since these files should not be
included at compile time directly, they may not be implicitly required to
exist for other compilation rules.
.sp
This policy provides compatibility for projects using file sets in targets
with generated header files that have not been updated.  Such projects
should be updated to express generated public headers in a file set.
For example:

\fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP and \fI\%FetchContent_Declare()\fP commands
treat relative \fBGIT_REPOSITORY\fP paths as being relative to the parent
project\(aqs remote.
.sp
Earlier versions of these commands always treated relative paths in
\fBGIT_REPOSITORY\fP as local paths, but the base directory it was treated
as relative to was both undocumented and unintuitive.  The \fBOLD\fP behavior
for this policy is to interpret relative paths used for \fBGIT_REPOSITORY\fP
as local paths relative to the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The parent directory of \fBSOURCE_DIR\fP for \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR\fP for \fI\%FetchContent_Declare()\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBNEW\fP behavior is to determine the remote from the parent project and
interpret the path relative to that remote.  The value of
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP when \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP or
\fI\%FetchContent_Declare()\fP is called determines the parent project.
The remote is selected according to the following (the first match is used):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the parent project is checked out on a branch with an upstream remote
defined, use that remote.
.IP \(bu 2

\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP select latest Windows SDK by default.

Visual Studio Generators select a Windows SDK version to put in the
\fBWindowsTargetPlatformVersion\fP setting in \fB\&.vcxproj\fP files.
CMake sets the \fI\%CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION\fP
variable to the selected SDK version.
.sp
Prior to CMake 3.27, the SDK version was always selected by the value of
the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP variable.  Users or toolchain files
could set that variable to one of the exact Windows SDK versions available
on the host system.  Since \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP defaults to
\fI\%CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP, and it is not guaranteed that a
matching Windows SDK version is available, CMake had to fall back to
using the latest Windows SDK version if no exact match was available.
This approach was problematic:
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT

MSVC debug information format flags are selected by an abstraction.
.sp
Compilers targeting the MSVC ABI have flags to select the debug information
format. Debug information format selection typically varies with build
configuration.
.sp
In CMake 3.24 and below, debug information format flags are added to
the default \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>\fP cache entries by CMake
automatically.  This allows users to edit their cache entries to adjust the
flags.  However, the presence of such default flags is problematic for
projects that want to choose a different runtime library programmatically.
In particular, it requires string editing of the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>\fP variables with knowledge of the
CMake builtin defaults so they can be replaced.
.sp
CMake 3.25 and above prefer to leave the debug information format flags
out of the default \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>\fP values and instead
offer a first\-class abstraction.  The
\fI\%CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT\fP variable and
\fI\%MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT\fP target property may be set to
select the MSVC debug information format.  If they are not set, CMake
enables debug information in debug configurations using the default value
\fB$<$<CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo>:ProgramDatabase>\fP, if supported by the
compiler, and otherwise \fB$<$<CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo>:Embedded>\fP\&.
.sp
This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated

Apart from when using the Xcode generator and some Visual Studio generators,
CMake 3.23 and below will set environment variables like \fI\%CC\fP,
\fI\%CXX\fP, etc. when the corresponding language is enabled.
This only occurs on the very first time CMake is run in a build directory,
and the environment variables are only defined at configure time, not build
time. On subsequent CMake runs, these environment variables are not set,
opening up the opportunity for different behavior between the first and
subsequent CMake runs. CMake 3.24 and above prefer to not set these
environment variables when a language is enabled, even on the first run in
a build directory.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy sets the relevant environment variable
on the first run when a language is enabled. The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this
policy does not set any such environment variables.

\fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP supports the \fI\%$<LINK_ONLY:...>\fP

CMake 3.23 and below documented the \fI\%$<LINK_ONLY:...>\fP generator
expression only for use in \fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\&.
When used in \fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP, the content guarded inside
\fI\%$<LINK_ONLY:...>\fP was always used, even when collecting non\-linking
usage requirements such as \fI\%INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP\&.
.sp
CMake 3.24 and above prefer to support \fI\%$<LINK_ONLY:...>\fP, when

Compiler id for MCST LCC compilers is now \fBLCC\fP, not \fBGNU\fP\&.
.sp
CMake 3.23 and above recognize MCST LCC compiler as a different from \fBGNU\fP,
with its own command line and set of capabilities.
CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID\fP variable to \fBLCC\fP instead
of \fBGNU\fP\&. However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for
LCC is \fBGNU\fP as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.23.
Therefore this policy determines for MCST LCC compiler which
compiler id to report in the \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID\fP
variable after language \fB<LANG>\fP is enabled by the \fI\%project()\fP
or \fI\%enable_language()\fP command.  The policy must be set prior
to the invocation of either command.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to use compiler id \fBGNU\fP (and set
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION\fP to the supported GNU compiler version.)
\fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy is to use compiler id \fBLCC\fP, and set

The \fI\%find_file()\fP, \fI\%find_path()\fP, \fI\%find_library()\fP and
\fI\%find_program()\fP commands cache their result in the variable specified
by their first argument.  Prior to CMake 3.21, if a cache variable of that
name already existed before the call but the cache variable had no type, any
non\-cache variable of the same name would be discarded and the cache variable
was always used (see also \fI\%CMP0126\fP for a different but similar
behavior).  This contradicts the convention that a non\-cache variable should
take precedence over a cache variable of the same name.  Such a situation can
arise if a user sets a cache variable on the command line without specifying
a type, such as \fBcmake \-DMYVAR=blah ...\fP instead of
\fBcmake \-DMYVAR:FILEPATH=blah\fP\&.
.sp
Related to the above, if a cache variable of the specified name already exists
and it \fIdoes\fP have a type, the various \fBfind_...()\fP commands would return
that value unchanged.  In particular, if it contained a relative path, it
would not be converted to an absolute path in this situation.
.sp
When policy \fBCMP0125\fP is set to \fBOLD\fP or is unset, the behavior is as
described above.  When it is set to \fBNEW\fP, the behavior is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If a non\-cache variable of the specified name exists when the \fBfind_...()\fP
command is called, its value will be used regardless of whether a cache
variable of the same name already exists or not.  A cache variable will not
be created in this case if no such cache variable existed before.
If a cache variable of the specified name did already exist, the cache will
be updated to match the non\-cache variable.
.IP \(bu 2
The various \fBfind...()\fP commands will always provide an absolute path in
the result variable, except where a relative path provided by a cache or
non\-cache variable cannot be resolved to an existing path.

for \fBARMClang\fP\&.  For example, the \fB\-mcpu=cortex\-m33\fP flag is added when
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR\fP equals \fBcortex\-m33\fP\&.  CMake requires
projects to set either variable or it raises a fatal error.  However, the
project may need to additionally specify CPU features using e.g.
\fB\-mcpu=cortex\-m33+nodsp\fP, conflicting with the \fB\-mcpu=cortex\-m33\fP added

\fI\%LANGUAGE\fP source file property explicitly compiles as specified

The \fI\%LANGUAGE\fP source file property is documented to mean that the
source file is written in the specified language.  In CMake 3.19 and below,
setting this property causes CMake to compile the source file using the

flag to tell the compiler to treat the source as the specified language
for MSVC\-like, XL, and Embarcadero compilers for the \fBCXX\fP language.
CMake 3.20 and above prefer to also explicitly tell the compiler to use
the specified language using a flag such as \fB\-x c\fP on all compilers

MSVC RTTI flag \fB/GR\fP is not added to
\fI\%CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS\fP by default.
.sp
When using MSVC\-like compilers in CMake 3.19 and below, the RTTI flag
\fB/GR\fP is added to \fI\%CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS\fP by
default.  This behavior is left from support for MSVC versions from Visual
Studio 2003 and below that did not enable RTTI by default.  It is no longer
necessary.  Furthermore, it is problematic for projects that want to change
to \fB/GR\-\fP programmatically.  In particular, it requires string editing of
the \fI\%CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS\fP variable with knowledge
of the CMake builtin default so it can be replaced.
.sp
CMake 3.20 and above prefer to leave out \fB/GR\fP from the value of
\fI\%CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS\fP by default.
.sp
This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated

Ninja generators transform \fBDEPFILE\fP s from \fI\%add_custom_command()\fP\&.
.sp
In CMake 3.19 and below, files given to the \fBDEPFILE\fP argument of
\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP were passed directly to Ninja\(aqs \fBdepfile\fP
variable without any path resolution. This meant that if
\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP was called from a subdirectory (created by
\fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP), the \fBDEPFILE\fP argument would have to be either
an absolute path or a path relative to \fI\%CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP, rather
than \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP\&. In addition, no transformation was
done on the file listed in \fBDEPFILE\fP, which meant that the paths within the
\fBDEPFILE\fP had the same restrictions.
.sp
Starting with CMake 3.20, the \fBDEPFILE\fP argument is relative to
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP (unless it is absolute), and the paths in
the \fBDEPFILE\fP are also relative to \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP\&.
CMake automatically transforms the paths in the \fBDEPFILE\fP (unless they are
absolute) after the custom command is run. The file listed in \fBDEPFILE\fP is
not modified in any way. Instead, CMake writes the transformation to its own
internal file, and passes this internal file to Ninja\(aqs \fBdepfile\fP variable.
This transformation happens regardless of whether or not \fBDEPFILE\fP is
relative, and regardless of whether or not \fI\%add_custom_command()\fP is
called from a subdirectory.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to pass the \fBDEPFILE\fP to Ninja
unaltered. The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy is to transform the \fBDEPFILE\fP
after running the custom command. The status of \fBCMP0116\fP is recorded at the
time of the custom command\(aqs creation, and you can have custom commands in the

\fI\%ExternalProject\fP step targets fully adopt their steps.
.sp
The \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP \fBSTEP_TARGETS\fP option, and the
\fI\%ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()\fP function, can be used to
create build targets for individual steps of an external project.
.sp
In CMake 3.18 and below, step targets have some limitations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Step targets always depend on targets named by the
\fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP \fBDEPENDS\fP option even though
not all steps need them.  In order to allow step targets to be created
without those dependencies, the \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP
\fBINDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS\fP option or the
\fI\%ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()\fP \fBNO_DEPENDS\fP option may
be used.  However, adding such \(dqindependent\(dq step targets makes sense
only for specific steps such as \fBdownload\fP, \fBupdate\fP, and \fBpatch\fP
because they do not need any of the external project\(aqs build dependencies.
Furthermore, it does not make sense to create independent step targets
for steps that depend on non\-independent steps.  Such rules are not
enforced, and projects that do not follow them can generate build systems
with confusing and generator\-specific behavior.
.IP \(bu 2
Step targets hold copies of the custom commands implementing their
steps that are separate from the copies in the primary target created
by \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP, and the primary target does not
depend on the step targets.  In parallel builds that drive the primary
target and step targets concurrently, multiple copies of the steps\(aq
commands may run concurrently and race each other.
.sp
Also, prior to policy \fI\%CMP0113\fP, the step targets generated
by \fI\%Makefile Generators\fP also contain all the custom commands
on which their step depends.  This can lead to repeated execution of
those steps even in serial builds.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In CMake 3.19 and above, the \fI\%ExternalProject\fP module prefers
a revised design to address these problems:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Each step is classified as \(dqindependent\(dq if it does not depend

The \fBdownload\fP, \fBupdate\fP, and \fBpatch\fP steps are independent.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBconfigure\fP, \fBbuild\fP, \fBtest\fP, and \fBinstall\fP steps are not.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For custom steps, the \fI\%ExternalProject_Add_Step()\fP command provides
an \fBINDEPENDENT\fP option to mark them as independent.  It is an error to
mark a step as independent if it depends on other steps that are not.  Note
that this use of the term \(dqindependent\(dq refers only to independence from
external targets and is orthogonal to a step\(aqs dependencies on other steps.
.IP \(bu 2
Step targets created by the \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP \fBSTEP_TARGETS\fP
option or the \fI\%ExternalProject_Add_Step()\fP function are now
independent if and only if their steps are marked as independent.
The \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP \fBINDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS\fP option
and \fI\%ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()\fP \fBNO_DEPENDS\fP option
are no longer allowed.
.IP \(bu 2
Step targets, when created, are fully responsible for holding the
custom commands implementing their steps.  The primary target created
by \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP depends on the step targets, and the
step targets depend on each other.  The target\-level dependencies match
the file\-level dependencies used by the custom commands for each step.
.sp
When the \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP \fBUPDATE_DISCONNECTED\fP or
\fBTEST_EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN\fP option is used, or the
\fI\%ExternalProject_Add_Step()\fP \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN\fP option is used
for a custom step, some step targets may be created automatically.
These are needed to hold the steps commonly depended upon by the primary
target and the disconnected step targets.

The \fI\%mark_as_advanced()\fP command no longer creates a cache entry if one

In CMake 3.16 and below, if a variable was not defined at all or just defined

linkers on ELF\-based systems (e.g. Linux and FreeBSD) allow certain keywords in
\fBRPATH\fP entries, such as \fB${ORIGIN}\fP (More details are available in the
\fBld.so\fP man pages on those systems). The syntax of these keywords can match
CMake\(aqs variable syntax. In order to not be substituted (usually to an empty
string) already by the intermediary \fBcmake_install.cmake\fP script, the user had
to double\-escape such \fBRPATH\fP keywords, e.g.
\fBset(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH \(dq\e\e\e${ORIGIN}/../lib\(dq)\fP\&. Since the intermediary
\fBcmake_install.cmake\fP script is an implementation detail of CMake, CMake 3.16

MSVC runtime library flags are selected by an abstraction.
.sp
Compilers targeting the MSVC ABI have flags to select the MSVC runtime library.
Runtime library selection typically varies with build configuration because
there is a separate runtime library for Debug builds.
.sp
In CMake 3.14 and below, MSVC runtime library selection flags are added to
the default \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>\fP cache entries by CMake
automatically.  This allows users to edit their cache entries to adjust the
flags.  However, the presence of such default flags is problematic for
projects that want to choose a different runtime library programmatically.
In particular, it requires string editing of the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>\fP variables with knowledge of the
CMake builtin defaults so they can be replaced.
.sp
CMake 3.15 and above prefer to leave the MSVC runtime library selection flags
out of the default \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>\fP values and instead

Compiler id for IBM Clang\-based XL compilers is now \fBXLClang\fP\&.

CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the

\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP allows use with targets in other directories.
.sp
Prior to CMake 3.13 the \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP command did not
accept targets not created in the calling directory as its first argument
for calls that update the \fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP of the target itself.
It did accidentally accept targets from other directories on calls that
only update the \fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP, but would simply
add entries to the property as if the call were made in the original
directory.  Thus link interface libraries specified this way were always
looked up by generators in the scope of the original target rather than
in the scope that called \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP\&.
.sp
CMake 3.13 now allows the \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP command to
be called from any directory to add link dependencies and link interface
libraries to targets created in other directories.  The entries are added
to \fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP and \fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
using a special (internal) suffix to tell the generators to look up the
names in the calling scope rather than the scope that created the target.
.sp
This policy provides compatibility with projects that already use
\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP with the \fBINTERFACE\fP keyword
on a target in another directory to add \fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
entries to be looked up in the target\(aqs directory.  Such projects should
be updated to be aware of the new scoping rules in that case.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior of this policy is to disallow
\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP calls naming targets from another directory
except in the previously accidentally allowed case of using the \fBINTERFACE\fP
keyword only.  The \fBNEW\fP behavior of this policy is to allow all such
calls but use the new scoping rules.

\fI\%option()\fP honors normal variables.
.sp
The \fI\%option()\fP command is typically used to create a cache entry
to allow users to set the option.  However, there are cases in which a
normal (non\-cached) variable of the same name as the option may be
defined by the project prior to calling the \fI\%option()\fP command.
For example, a project that embeds another project as a subdirectory
may want to hard\-code options of the subproject to build the way it needs.
.sp
For historical reasons in CMake 3.12 and below the \fI\%option()\fP
command \fIremoves\fP a normal (non\-cached) variable of the same name when:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a cache entry of the specified name does not exist at all, or
.IP \(bu 2
a cache entry of the specified name exists but has not been given
a type (e.g. via \fB\-D<name>=ON\fP on the command line).
.UNINDENT
.sp
In both of these cases (typically on the first run in a new build tree),
the \fI\%option()\fP command gives the cache entry type \fBBOOL\fP and
removes any normal (non\-cached) variable of the same name.  In the
remaining case that the cache entry of the specified name already
exists and has a type (typically on later runs in a build tree), the
\fI\%option()\fP command changes nothing and any normal variable of
the same name remains set.
.sp
In CMake 3.13 and above the \fI\%option()\fP command prefers to
do nothing when a normal variable of the given name already exists.
It does not create or update a cache entry or remove the normal variable.
The new behavior is consistent between the first and later runs in a
build tree.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that have
not been updated to expect the new behavior.
.sp
When the \fI\%option()\fP command sees a normal variable of the given
name:

The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to proceed even when a normal

normal variable is removed.

CMake 3.9 and newer prefer to add IPO flags whenever the

produce an error if flags are not known to CMake for the current compiler.
Since a given compiler may not support IPO flags in all environments in which
it is used, it is now the project\(aqs responsibility to use the
\fI\%CheckIPOSupported\fP module to check for support before enabling the
\fI\%INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP target property.  This approach

Link libraries by full path even in implicit directories.
.sp
Policy \fI\%CMP0003\fP was introduced with the intention of always
linking library files by full path when a full path is given to the
\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP command.  However, on some platforms
(e.g. HP\-UX) the compiler front\-end adds alternative library search paths
for the current architecture (e.g. \fB/usr/lib/<arch>\fP has alternatives
to libraries in \fB/usr/lib\fP for the current architecture).
On such platforms the \fI\%find_library()\fP may find a library such as
\fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP that does not belong to the current architecture.
.sp
Prior to policy \fI\%CMP0003\fP projects would still build in such
cases because the incorrect library path would be converted to \fB\-lfoo\fP
on the link line and the linker would find the proper library in the
arch\-specific search path provided by the compiler front\-end implicitly.
At the time we chose to remain compatible with such projects by always
converting library files found in implicit link directories to \fB\-lfoo\fP
flags to ask the linker to search for them.  This approach allowed existing
projects to continue to build while still linking to libraries outside
implicit link directories via full path (such as those in the build tree).
.sp
CMake does allow projects to override this behavior by using an
\fI\%IMPORTED library target\fP with its
\fI\%IMPORTED_LOCATION\fP property set to the desired full path to
a library file.  In fact, many \fI\%Find Modules\fP are learning to provide
\fI\%Imported Targets\fP instead of just the traditional \fBFoo_LIBRARIES\fP
variable listing library files.  However, this makes the link line
generated for a library found by a Find Module depend on whether it
is linked through an imported target or not, which is inconsistent.
Furthermore, this behavior has been a source of confusion because the
generated link line for a library file depends on its location.  It is
also problematic for projects trying to link statically because flags
like \fB\-Wl,\-Bstatic \-lfoo \-Wl,\-Bdynamic\fP may be used to help the linker
select \fBlibfoo.a\fP instead of \fBlibfoo.so\fP but then leak dynamic linking
to following libraries.  (See the \fI\%LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC\fP
target property for a solution typically used for that problem.)
.sp
When the special case for libraries in implicit link directories was first
introduced the list of implicit link directories was simply hard\-coded
(e.g. \fB/lib\fP, \fB/usr/lib\fP, and a few others).  Since that time, CMake
has learned to detect the implicit link directories used by the compiler
front\-end.  If necessary, the \fI\%find_library()\fP command could be
taught to use this information to help find libraries of the proper
architecture.
.sp
For these reasons, CMake 3.3 and above prefer to drop the special case
and link libraries by full path even when they are in implicit link
directories.  Policy \fBCMP0060\fP provides compatibility for existing
projects.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to ask the linker to search for

Ninja requires custom command byproducts to be explicit.
.sp
When an intermediate file generated during the build is consumed
by an expensive operation or a large tree of dependents, one may
reduce the work needed for an incremental rebuild by updating the
file timestamp only when its content changes.  With this approach
the generation rule must have a separate output file that is always
updated with a new timestamp that is newer than any dependencies of
the rule so that the build tool re\-runs the rule only when the input
changes.  We refer to the separate output file as a rule\(aqs \fIwitness\fP
and the generated file as a rule\(aqs \fIbyproduct\fP\&.
.sp
Byproducts may not be listed as outputs because their timestamps are
allowed to be older than the inputs.  No build tools (like \fBmake\fP)
that existed when CMake was designed have a way to express byproducts.
Therefore CMake versions prior to 3.2 had no way to specify them.
Projects typically left byproducts undeclared in the rules that
generate them.  For example:

This works well for all generators except \fI\%Ninja\fP\&.
The Ninja build tool sees a rule listing \fBbyproduct.txt\fP
as a dependency and no rule listing it as an output.  Ninja then
complains that there is no way to satisfy the dependency and
stops building even though there are order\-only dependencies
that ensure \fBbyproduct.txt\fP will exist before its consumers
need it.  See discussion of this problem in \fI\%Ninja Issue 760\fP
for further details on why Ninja works this way.
.sp
Instead of leaving byproducts undeclared in the rules that generate
them, Ninja expects byproducts to be listed along with other outputs.
Such rules may be marked with a \fBrestat\fP option that tells Ninja
to check the timestamps of outputs after the rules run.  This
prevents byproducts whose timestamps do not change from causing
their dependents to re\-build unnecessarily.
.sp
Since the above approach does not tell CMake what custom command
generates \fBbyproduct.txt\fP, the Ninja generator does not have
enough information to add the byproduct as an output of any rule.
CMake 2.8.12 and above work around this problem and allow projects
using the above approach to build by generating \fBphony\fP build
rules to tell Ninja to tolerate such missing files.  However, this
workaround prevents Ninja from diagnosing a dependency that is
really missing.  It also works poorly in in\-source builds where
every custom command dependency, even on source files, needs to
be treated this way because CMake does not have enough information
to know which files are generated as byproducts of custom commands.
.SS Introducing Byproducts
.sp
CMake 3.2 introduced the \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP option to the
\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP and \fI\%add_custom_target()\fP
commands.  This option allows byproducts to be specified explicitly:
.INDENT 0.0

          byproduct.txt # timestamp may not change

.sp
The \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP option is used by the \fI\%Ninja\fP generator
to list byproducts among the outputs of the custom commands that
generate them, and is ignored by other generators.
.sp
CMake 3.3 and above prefer to require projects to specify custom
command byproducts explicitly so that it can avoid using the
\fBphony\fP rule workaround altogether.  Policy \fBCMP0058\fP was
introduced to provide compatibility with existing projects that
still need the workaround.
.sp
This policy has no effect on generators other than \fI\%Ninja\fP\&.
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to generate Ninja \fBphony\fP
rules for unknown dependencies in the build tree.  The \fBNEW\fP
behavior for this policy is to not generate these and instead
require projects to specify custom command \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP explicitly.
.sp
This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3\&.
It may be set by \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP or \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP\&.
If it is not set, CMake warns when it sees unknown dependencies in out\-of\-source build trees, and uses \fBOLD\fP behavior.

Honor link flags in \fI\%try_compile()\fP source\-file signature.
.sp
The \fI\%try_compile()\fP command source\-file signature generates a
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file to build the source file into an executable.
In order to compile the source the same way as it might be compiled
by the calling project, the generated project sets the value of the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS\fP variable to that in the calling project.
The value of the \fI\%CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS\fP variable may be
needed in some cases too, but CMake 3.1 and lower did not set it in
the generated project.  CMake 3.2 and above prefer to set it so that
linker flags are honored as well as compiler flags.  This policy
provides compatibility with the pre\-3.2 behavior.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to not set the value of the

to the legacy implementation in most cases, some corner cases were
cleaned up to simplify the behavior.  Specifically:
.INDENT 0.0

Literal \fB${VAR}\fP reference syntax may contain only
alphanumeric characters (\fBA\-Z\fP, \fBa\-z\fP, \fB0\-9\fP) and
the characters \fB_\fP, \fB\&.\fP, \fB/\fP, \fB\-\fP, and \fB+\fP\&.
Note that \fB$\fP is technically allowed in the \fBNEW\fP behavior, but is
invalid for \fBOLD\fP behavior.  This is due to an oversight during the
implementation of \fBCMP0053\fP and its use as a literal variable
reference is discouraged for this reason.
Variables with other characters in their name may still
be referenced indirectly, e.g.
.INDENT 2.0

QNX qcc is just \fBGNU\fP as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0.
Therefore this policy determines for QNX qcc which compiler id to

Double colon in target name means \fBALIAS\fP or \fBIMPORTED\fP target.
.sp
CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed the use of targets and files with double
colons in \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP, with some buildsystem generators.
.sp
The use of double\-colons is a common pattern used to namespace \fBIMPORTED\fP
targets and \fBALIAS\fP targets.  When computing the link dependencies of
a target, the name of each dependency could either be a target, or a file
on disk.  Previously, if a target was not found with a matching name, the name
was considered to refer to a file on disk.  This can lead to confusing error
messages if there is a typo in what should be a target name.

assumption that all necessary information is available at
configure\-time to determine the final location and filename of the
target.  However, this property is not fully determined until later at
generate\-time.  At generate time, the \fI\%$<TARGET_FILE>\fP generator
expression can be used to determine the eventual \fI\%LOCATION\fP of a target

Compiler id for Apple Clang is now \fBAppleClang\fP\&.

CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the

Apple Clang is just \fBClang\fP as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0.

Plain and keyword \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP signatures cannot be mixed.
.sp
CMake 2.8.12 introduced the \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP signature using
the \fBPUBLIC\fP, \fBPRIVATE\fP, and \fBINTERFACE\fP keywords to generalize the
\fBLINK_PUBLIC\fP and \fBLINK_PRIVATE\fP keywords introduced in CMake 2.8.7.
Use of signatures with any of these keywords sets the link interface of a
target explicitly, even if empty.  This produces confusing behavior
when used in combination with the historical behavior of the plain
\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP signature.  For example, consider the code:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
target_link_libraries(mylib A)
target_link_libraries(mylib PRIVATE B)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After the first line the link interface has not been set explicitly so
CMake would use the link implementation, A, as the link interface.
However, the second line sets the link interface to empty.  In order
to avoid this subtle behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the
plain and keyword signatures of \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP for a single
target.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to allow keyword and plain
\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP signatures to be mixed.  The \fBNEW\fP behavior for

\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP defines the link interface.
.sp
CMake 2.8.11 constructed the \(aqlink interface\(aq of a target from
properties matching \fB(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?\fP\&.
The modern way to specify config\-sensitive content is to use generator
expressions and the \fBIMPORTED_\fP prefix makes uniform processing of the
link interface with generator expressions impossible.  The
\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP target property was introduced as a
replacement in CMake 2.8.12.  This new property is named consistently
with the \fBINTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP, \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP
and \fBINTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS\fP properties.  For in\-build targets, CMake
will use the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property as the source of the
link interface only if policy \fBCMP0022\fP is \fBNEW\fP\&.  When exporting a target
which has this policy set to \fBNEW\fP, only the \fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
property will be processed and generated for the \fBIMPORTED\fP target by
default.  A new option to the \fI\%install(EXPORT)\fP and export commands
allows export of the old\-style properties for compatibility with
downstream users of CMake versions older than 2.8.12.  The
\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP command will no longer populate the properties
matching \fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?\fP if this policy is \fBNEW\fP\&.

CMake 2.8.10.2 and lower allowed the \fI\%INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target

Automatically link Qt executables to \fBqtmain\fP target on Windows.

CMake 2.8.10 and lower required users of Qt to always specify a link
dependency to the \fBqtmain.lib\fP static library manually on Windows.
CMake 2.8.11 gained the ability to evaluate generator expressions
while determining the link dependencies from \fBIMPORTED\fP targets.  This
allows CMake itself to automatically link executables which link to Qt
to the \fBqtmain.lib\fP library when using \fBIMPORTED\fP Qt targets.  For
applications already linking to \fBqtmain.lib\fP, this should have little
impact.  For applications which supply their own alternative WinMain
implementation and for applications which use the QAxServer library,
this automatic linking will need to be disabled as per the

Ignore \fBCMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS\fP variable.
.sp
CMake 2.8.8 and lower compiled sources in \fBSHARED\fP and \fBMODULE\fP libraries
using the value of the undocumented \fBCMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS\fP
platform variable.  The variable contained platform\-specific flags
needed to compile objects for shared libraries.  Typically it included
a flag such as \fB\-fPIC\fP for position independent code but also included
other flags needed on certain platforms.  CMake 2.8.9 and higher
prefer instead to use the \fI\%POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP target
property to determine what targets should be position independent, and new
undocumented platform variables to select flags while ignoring
\fBCMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS\fP completely.
.sp
The default for either approach produces identical compilation flags,
but if a project modifies \fBCMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS\fP from its
original value this policy determines which approach to use.

in order to link to library A.  An analysis was performed to order
multiple link directories such that the linker would find library A in
the desired location, but there are cases in which this does not work.
CMake versions 2.6 and above use the more reliable approach of passing

search path added for library A allowed library B to be found.
.sp
In order to support projects depending on linker search paths added by
linking to libraries with known full paths, the \fBOLD\fP behavior for this
policy will add the linker search paths even though they are not

updated to work with the corrected linking approach:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.6)
link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
.ft P

.UNINDENT

Even better, library B may be specified with a full path:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so /path/to/libB.so)

When all items on the link line have known paths CMake does not check
this policy so it has no effect.
.sp
Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for at most one
target.  This avoids flooding users with messages for every target
when setting the policy once will probably fix all targets.
.sp
This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0\&.
It may be set by \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP or \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP\&.
If it is not set, CMake warns, and uses \fBOLD\fP behavior.

Logical target names must be globally unique.
.sp
Targets names created with \fI\%add_executable()\fP, \fI\%add_library()\fP, or
\fI\%add_custom_target()\fP are logical build target names.  Logical target
names must be globally unique because:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in CMake
  code and on make tool command lines.
\- Logical names are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators
  to produce meaningful project names for the targets.
.ft P

.UNINDENT

.sp
The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to
correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the
\fI\%OUTPUT_NAME\fP target property to create two targets with the same
physical name while keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets
must simply have globally unique names (unless one uses the global
property \fI\%ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS\fP with a Makefiles generator).

\fBCMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY\fP should no longer be used.
.sp
The behavior is to check \fBCMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY\fP and present
it to the user.  The \fBNEW\fP behavior is to ignore
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY completely.
.sp
In CMake 2.4 and below the variable \fBCMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY\fP was
used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.  In
CMake 2.6 and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies
and the \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP command.  However, CMake must still check
\fBCMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY\fP for projects written for CMake 2.4 and
below.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0\&.

A minimum required CMake version must be specified.
.sp
CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which
they have been written.  This policy has been put in place so users
trying to build the project may be told when they need to update their
CMake.  Specifying a version also helps the project build with CMake
versions newer than that specified.  Use the \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP
command at the top of your main \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION <major>.<minor>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fB<major>.<minor>\fP is the version of CMake you want to support
(such as \fB3.14\fP).  The command will ensure that at least the given
version of CMake is running and help newer versions be compatible with
the project.  See documentation of \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP for
details.
.sp
Note that the command invocation must appear in the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP
file itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient.  However,
the  \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP command may be called to set policy \fBCMP0000\fP
to \fBOLD\fP or \fBNEW\fP behavior explicitly.  The \fBOLD\fP behavior is to
silently ignore the missing invocation.  The \fBNEW\fP behavior is to issue
an error instead of a warning.  An included file may set \fBCMP0000\fP
explicitly to affect how this policy is enforced for the main
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.
