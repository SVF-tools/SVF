.SH NAME
cmake-generators \- CMake Generators Reference
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
A \fICMake Generator\fP is responsible for writing the input files for
a native build system.  Exactly one of the \fI\%CMake Generators\fP must be
selected for a build tree to determine what native build system is to
be used.  Optionally one of the \fI\%Extra Generators\fP may be selected
as a variant of some of the \fI\%Command\-Line Build Tool Generators\fP to
produce project files for an auxiliary IDE.
.sp
CMake Generators are platform\-specific so each may be available only
on certain platforms.  The \fI\%cmake(1)\fP command\-line tool
\fI\%\-\-help\fP output lists available generators on the
current platform.  Use its \fI\%\-G\fP option to specify the
generator for a new build tree. The \fI\%cmake\-gui(1)\fP offers
interactive selection of a generator when creating a new build tree.
.SH CMAKE GENERATORS
.SS Command\-Line Build Tool Generators
.sp
These generators support command\-line build tools.  In order to use them,
one must launch CMake from a command\-line prompt whose environment is
already configured for the chosen compiler and build tool.
.SS Makefile Generators
.SS Borland Makefiles
.sp
Generates Borland makefiles.
.SS MSYS Makefiles
.sp
Generates makefiles for use with MSYS (Minimal SYStem)
\fBmake\fP under the MSYS shell.
.sp
Use this generator in a MSYS shell prompt and using \fBmake\fP as the build
tool.  The generated makefiles use \fB/bin/sh\fP as the shell to launch build
rules.  They are not compatible with a Windows command prompt.
.sp
To build under a Windows command prompt, use the
\fI\%MinGW Makefiles\fP generator.
.SS MinGW Makefiles
.sp
Generates makefiles for use with \fBmingw32\-make\fP under a Windows command
prompt.
.sp
Use this generator under a Windows command prompt with
MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) in the \fBPATH\fP
and using \fBmingw32\-make\fP as the build tool.  The generated makefiles use
\fBcmd.exe\fP as the shell to launch build rules.  They are not compatible with
MSYS or a unix shell.
.sp
To build under the MSYS shell, use the \fI\%MSYS Makefiles\fP generator.
.SS NMake Makefiles
.sp
Generates NMake makefiles.
.SS NMake Makefiles JOM
.sp
Generates JOM makefiles.
.sp
New in version 3.8: \fI\%CodeBlocks\fP generator can be used as an extra generator.

.SS Unix Makefiles
.sp
Generates standard UNIX makefiles.
.sp
A hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into the build tree.  Use
any standard UNIX\-style make program to build the project through
the \fBall\fP target and install the project through the \fBinstall\fP
(or \fBinstall/strip\fP) target.
.sp
For each subdirectory \fBsub/dir\fP of the project a UNIX makefile will
be created, containing the following targets:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBall\fP
Depends on all targets required by the subdirectory.
.TP
.B \fBinstall\fP
Runs the install step in the subdirectory, if any.
.TP
.B \fBinstall/strip\fP
Runs the install step in the subdirectory followed by a \fBCMAKE_STRIP\fP command,
if any.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_STRIP\fP variable will contain the platform\(aqs \fBstrip\fP utility, which
removes symbols information from generated binaries.
.TP
.B \fBtest\fP
Runs the test step in the subdirectory, if any.
.TP
.B \fBpackage\fP
Runs the package step in the subdirectory, if any.
.UNINDENT
.SS Watcom WMake
.sp
Generates Watcom WMake makefiles.
.SS Ninja Generators
.SS Ninja
.sp
Generates \fBbuild.ninja\fP files.
.sp
A \fBbuild.ninja\fP file is generated into the build tree.  Use the ninja
program to build the project through the \fBall\fP target and install the
project through the \fBinstall\fP (or \fBinstall/strip\fP) target.
.sp
For each subdirectory \fBsub/dir\fP of the project, additional targets
are generated:
.sp
\fBsub/dir/all\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
New in version 3.6: Depends on all targets required by the subdirectory.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBsub/dir/install\fP

.INDENT 3.5
New in version 3.7: Runs the install step in the subdirectory, if any.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBsub/dir/install/strip\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
New in version 3.7: Runs the install step in the subdirectory followed by a \fBCMAKE_STRIP\fP command,
if any.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_STRIP\fP variable will contain the platform\(aqs \fBstrip\fP utility, which
removes symbols information from generated binaries.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SS Fortran Support
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
The \fBNinja\fP generator conditionally supports Fortran when the \fBninja\fP
tool is at least version 1.10 (which has the required features).
.SS Swift Support
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
The Swift support is experimental, not considered stable, and may change
in future releases of CMake.
.SS See Also
.sp
New in version 3.17: The \fI\%Ninja Multi\-Config\fP generator is similar to the \fBNinja\fP
generator, but generates multiple configurations at once.

.SS Ninja Multi\-Config
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
Generates multiple \fBbuild\-<Config>.ninja\fP files.
.sp
This generator is very much like the \fI\%Ninja\fP generator, but with
some key differences. Only these differences will be discussed in this
document.
.sp
Unlike the \fI\%Ninja\fP generator, \fBNinja Multi\-Config\fP generates
multiple configurations at once with \fI\%CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP
instead of only one configuration with \fI\%CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\fP\&. One
\fBbuild\-<Config>.ninja\fP file will be generated for each of these
configurations (with \fB<Config>\fP being the configuration name.) These files
are intended to be run with \fBninja \-f build\-<Config>.ninja\fP\&. A
\fBbuild.ninja\fP file is also generated, using the configuration from either
\fI\%CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE\fP or the first item from
\fI\%CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP\&.
.sp
\fBcmake \-\-build . \-\-config <Config>\fP will always use \fBbuild\-<Config>.ninja\fP
to build. If no \fI\%\-\-config\fP argument is
specified, \fI\%cmake \-\-build .\fP will use \fBbuild.ninja\fP\&.
.sp
Each \fBbuild\-<Config>.ninja\fP file contains \fB<target>\fP targets as well as
\fB<target>:<Config>\fP targets, where \fB<Config>\fP is the same as the
configuration specified in \fBbuild\-<Config>.ninja\fP Additionally, if
cross\-config mode is enabled, \fBbuild\-<Config>.ninja\fP may contain
\fB<target>:<OtherConfig>\fP targets, where \fB<OtherConfig>\fP is a cross\-config,
as well as \fB<target>:all\fP, which builds the target in all cross\-configs. See
below for how to enable cross\-config mode.
.sp
The \fBNinja Multi\-Config\fP generator recognizes the following variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fI\%CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP
Specifies the total set of configurations to build. Unlike with other
multi\-config generators, this variable has a value of
\fBDebug;Release;RelWithDebInfo\fP by default.
.TP
.B \fI\%CMAKE_CROSS_CONFIGS\fP
Specifies a \fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP of
configurations available from all \fBbuild\-<Config>.ninja\fP files.
.TP
.B \fI\%CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE\fP
Specifies the configuration to use by default in a \fBbuild.ninja\fP file.
.TP
.B \fI\%CMAKE_DEFAULT_CONFIGS\fP
Specifies a \fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP of
configurations to build for a target in \fBbuild.ninja\fP
if no \fB:<Config>\fP suffix is specified.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Consider the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(MultiConfigNinja C)

add_executable(generator generator.c)
add_custom_command(OUTPUT generated.c COMMAND generator generated.c)
add_library(generated ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/generated.c)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now assume you configure the project with \fBNinja Multi\-Config\fP and run one of
the following commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ninja \-f build\-Debug.ninja generated
# OR
cmake \-\-build . \-\-config Debug \-\-target generated
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would build the \fBDebug\fP configuration of \fBgenerator\fP, which would be
used to generate \fBgenerated.c\fP, which would be used to build the \fBDebug\fP
configuration of \fBgenerated\fP\&.
.sp
But if \fI\%CMAKE_CROSS_CONFIGS\fP is set to \fBall\fP, and you run the
following instead:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ninja \-f build\-Release.ninja generated:Debug
# OR
cmake \-\-build . \-\-config Release \-\-target generated:Debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would build the \fBRelease\fP configuration of \fBgenerator\fP, which would be
used to generate \fBgenerated.c\fP, which would be used to build the \fBDebug\fP
configuration of \fBgenerated\fP\&. This is useful for running a release\-optimized
version of a generator utility while still building the debug version of the
targets built with the generated code.
.SS Custom Commands
.sp
New in version 3.20.

.sp
The \fBNinja Multi\-Config\fP generator adds extra capabilities to
\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP and \fI\%add_custom_target()\fP through its
cross\-config mode. The \fBCOMMAND\fP, \fBDEPENDS\fP, and \fBWORKING_DIRECTORY\fP
arguments can be evaluated in the context of either the \(dqcommand config\(dq (the
\(dqnative\(dq configuration of the \fBbuild\-<Config>.ninja\fP file in use) or the
\(dqoutput config\(dq (the configuration used to evaluate the \fBOUTPUT\fP and
\fBBYPRODUCTS\fP).
.sp
If either \fBOUTPUT\fP or \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP names a path that is common to
more than one configuration (e.g. it does not use any generator expressions),
all arguments are evaluated in the command config by default.
If all \fBOUTPUT\fP and \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP paths are unique to each configuration
(e.g. by using the \fI\%$<CONFIG>\fP generator expression), the first argument of
\fBCOMMAND\fP is still evaluated in the command config by default, while all
subsequent arguments, as well as the arguments to \fBDEPENDS\fP and
\fBWORKING_DIRECTORY\fP, are evaluated in the output config. These defaults can
be overridden with the \fI\%$<OUTPUT_CONFIG:...>\fP and \fI\%$<COMMAND_CONFIG:...>\fP
generator\-expressions. Note that if a target is specified by its name in
\fBDEPENDS\fP, or as the first argument of \fBCOMMAND\fP, it is always evaluated
in the command config, even if it is wrapped in \fI\%$<OUTPUT_CONFIG:...>\fP
(because its plain name is not a generator expression).
.sp
As an example, consider the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT \(dq$<CONFIG>.txt\(dq
  COMMAND
    generator \(dq$<CONFIG>.txt\(dq
              \(dq$<OUTPUT_CONFIG:$<CONFIG>>\(dq
              \(dq$<COMMAND_CONFIG:$<CONFIG>>\(dq
  DEPENDS
    tgt1
    \(dq$<TARGET_FILE:tgt2>\(dq
    \(dq$<OUTPUT_CONFIG:$<TARGET_FILE:tgt3>>\(dq
    \(dq$<COMMAND_CONFIG:$<TARGET_FILE:tgt4>>\(dq
  )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Assume that \fBgenerator\fP, \fBtgt1\fP, \fBtgt2\fP, \fBtgt3\fP, and \fBtgt4\fP are all
executable targets, and assume that \fB$<CONFIG>.txt\fP is built in the \fBDebug\fP
output config using the \fBRelease\fP command config. The \fBRelease\fP build of
the \fBgenerator\fP target is called with \fBDebug.txt Debug Release\fP as
arguments. The command depends on the \fBRelease\fP builds of \fBtgt1\fP and
\fBtgt4\fP, and the \fBDebug\fP builds of \fBtgt2\fP and \fBtgt3\fP\&.
.sp
\fBPRE_BUILD\fP, \fBPRE_LINK\fP, and \fBPOST_BUILD\fP custom commands for targets
only get run in their \(dqnative\(dq configuration (the \fBRelease\fP configuration in
the \fBbuild\-Release.ninja\fP file) unless they have no \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP or their
\fBBYPRODUCTS\fP are unique per config. Consider the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_executable(exe main.c)
add_custom_command(
  TARGET exe
  POST_BUILD
  COMMAND
    ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E echo \(dqRunning no\-byproduct command\(dq
  )
add_custom_command(
  TARGET exe
  POST_BUILD
  COMMAND
    ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E echo
    \(dqRunning separate\-byproduct command for $<CONFIG>\(dq
  BYPRODUCTS $<CONFIG>.txt
  )
add_custom_command(
  TARGET exe
  POST_BUILD
  COMMAND
    ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E echo
    \(dqRunning common\-byproduct command for $<CONFIG>\(dq
  BYPRODUCTS exe.txt
  )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, if you build \fBexe:Debug\fP in \fBbuild\-Release.ninja\fP, the
first and second custom commands get run, since their byproducts are unique
per\-config, but the last custom command does not. However, if you build
\fBexe:Release\fP in \fBbuild\-Release.ninja\fP, all three custom commands get run.
.SS IDE Build Tool Generators
.sp
These generators support Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
project files.  Since the IDEs configure their own environment
one may launch CMake from any environment.
.SS Visual Studio Generators
.SS Visual Studio 6

.SS Platform Selection
.sp
The default target platform name (architecture) is \fBWin32\fP\&.
.sp
New in version 3.1: The \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP variable may be set, perhaps
via the \fI\%cmake \-A\fP option, to specify a target platform

to build with VS 10 2010 tools using the \fI\%Visual Studio 14 2015\fP
(or above) generator with \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP set to
\fBv100\fP, or by using the \fI\%NMake Makefiles\fP generator.
.SS Visual Studio 11 2012
.sp
Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio 11 2012 project files, but
the generator has been removed since CMake 3.28.  It is still possible
to build with VS 11 2012 tools using the \fI\%Visual Studio 14 2015\fP
(or above) generator with \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP set to \fBv110\fP,

The \fBv120\fP toolset that comes with Visual Studio 12 2013 is selected by
default.  The \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP option may be set, perhaps
via the \fI\%cmake \-T\fP option, to specify another toolset.
.sp
New in version 3.8: For each toolset that comes with this version of Visual Studio, there are
variants that are themselves compiled for 32\-bit (\fBx86\fP) and
64\-bit (\fBx64\fP) hosts (independent of the architecture they target).
By default this generator uses the 32\-bit variant even on a 64\-bit host.
One may explicitly request use of either the 32\-bit or 64\-bit host tools
by adding either \fBhost=x86\fP or \fBhost=x64\fP to the toolset specification.
See the \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP variable for details.

.sp
New in version 3.14: Added support for \fBhost=x86\fP option.

.SS Windows 10 SDK Maximum Version for VS 2015
.sp
New in version 3.19.

.sp
Microsoft stated in a \(dqWindows 10 October 2018 Update\(dq blog post that Windows
10 SDK versions (15063, 16299, 17134, 17763) are not supported by VS 2015 and
are only supported by VS 2017 and later.  Therefore by default CMake
automatically ignores Windows 10 SDKs beyond \fB10.0.14393.0\fP\&.
.sp
However, there are other recommendations for certain driver/Win32 builds that
indicate otherwise.  A user can override this behavior by either setting the
\fI\%CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM\fP to a false value
or setting the \fI\%CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM\fP to
the string value of the required maximum (e.g. \fB10.0.15063.0\fP).
.SS Visual Studio 15 2017
