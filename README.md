SVF is a static tool that enables scalable and precise interprocedural dependence analysis for C programs. SVF allows value-flow construction and pointer analysis to be performed iteratively, thereby providing increasingly improved precision for both. 

SVF accepts the points-to information generated by any pointer analysis (e.g., Andersen’s analysis) and constructs an interprocedural memory SSA form so that the def-use chains of both top-level and address-taken variables are captured. SVF is implemented on top of an industry-strength compiler [LLVM](http://llvm.org) (version 3.8.0). SVF contains a third party software package [CUDD-2.5.0](http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/) (Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)), which is used to encode path conditions.

<b>Multiple full PhD scholarship available (plus tuition fee waiver). We are looking for students to continue to work on SVF in the area of program analysis for software security. Please contact me and Prof.Jingling if you are interested (email: ysui@cse.unsw.edu.au and jingling@cse.unsw.edu.au).<b>
